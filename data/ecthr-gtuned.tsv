0	 The facts of the case, in particular the circumstances surrounding the death of the applicant’s brother İrfan Ağdaş on 13 May 1996, are disputed by the parties. On 13 May 1996, at about 7.00 p.m., the applicant’s brother İrfan Ağdaş, aged 17, was walking through the Alibeyköy neighbourhood. Three plain-clothed police officers, who were patrolling the neighbourhood in an unmarked car, noticed the newspaper which İrfan was carrying in his hand and began to follow him. The newspaper was Zafer Yolunda Kurtuluş (Salvation in the Path of Glory) known for its leftist point of view. When İrfan noticed that he was being followed, he started to run. At that moment two of the police officers got out of the car and opened fire. İrfan was shot and he fell to the ground. The police officers proceeded to kick him where he lay on the ground. A woman, A.B., a witness to the incident, ran to İrfan to help him. However, the police officers pushed her aside and put İrfan in the car	[0]	0	1	0

R., lodged with the Tarnow District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a private bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him with several counts of defamation. On 24 May 2004 the Tarnow District Court found the applicant guilty of five offences of defamation under Article 212 of the Criminal Code and acquitted him of the remaining charges. The applicant was ordered to pay a fine of 2,000 Polish zlotys (PLN), PLN 500 to a charity, and to reimburse the private prosecutors PLN 1,000 for the costs of the proceedings. The court found him guilty of damaging the good name of S.Tar TV in that, between April 2002 and July 2003, through a means of mass communication, namely the Internet portal www.uczciwosc.org.pl, and by sending letters to the Tarnow Regional Prosecutor, the Nat	[]	2	1	0

On 3 December 2006, he died and the application was continued by his son Mr Alexandru Leonard Panaitescu. On 8 May 2002, the applicant filed an action against the Bihor County Pensions Office seeking the annulment of a decision denying him the benefit of Law no. 189/2000, which provided for damages and certain facilities for persons persecuted by the Romanian authorities between 6 September 1940 and 6 March 1945 on ethnic grounds. By a decision of 3 June 2002, the Oradea Appeal Court found for the applicant, ordering the defendant to award him the benefits provided for in the above-mentioned Law. The decision became final on 28 January 2003. Accordingly, on 2 April 2003 the commission responsible for the enforcement of Law no. 189/2000 issued a new decision confirming the applicant’s status as a refugee and consequently as a beneficiary of that Law from 1 April 2	[0]	3	1	0
4	 The applicant, who was born in 1984, is a Sunni Muslim from Baghdad. The applicant arrived in Sweden on 4 September 2008. In support of his application for asylum, he stated in essence the following. He risked persecution in Iraq because he had worked as a professional soldier during the regime of Saddam Hussein and because he was involved in a blood feud after he had accidentally shot and killed a relative. He claimed to have served as a private in Fedayeen, a paramilitary group loyal to Saddam Hussein and the Ba’athist government, from January 2002 to March 2003. He had at the same time held a medium-level position in the Ba’ath party. Following the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, former members of Fedayeen had tried to recruit him to a new militia. When he had refused to join, he had been called a traitor and had received threatening letters. From January 2004 he had also been sought after frequently by the Iraqi authorities, the American troops and the Badr militia 	[]	1	1	1

He was hospitalised on several occasions in psychiatric hospitals in Lubliniec and Żurawica. The applicant lived in Nowy Lubliniec with his mother and handicapped sister. At the end of 2000 the applicant’s brother, who did not live with them, applied to the court submitting that the applicant had been aggressive, had been refusing to take his medication and had been abusing alcohol. On 22 December 2000 the applicant was partly deprived of his legal capacity by a court because of his mental disorder, as he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. On 28 August 2001 the Lubaczów District Court appointed his brother, Mr Zbigniew Kędzior, as his guardian (kurator). Subsequently, the guardian applied to the court to have the order varied and to have the applicant declared totally incapacitated. In the course of 	[2, 3]	2	1	0
6	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Yekaterinburg. He suffers from an occupational disease. On 15 May 1997 the applicant sued his former employers, private companies, for compensation for health damage.  The Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Yekaterinburg registered his statement of claim and listed the first preliminary hearing for 9 July 1997. Another preliminary hearing was held on 4 September 1997. Of six hearings listed between 5 February 1998 and 13 June 2000 two hearings were adjourned because the judge was ill or involved in other proceedings and two hearings were postponed for provision of additional evidence and obtaining statements by witnesses. In June 1999 and January 2000 the applicant asked the District Court to order expert medical examinations. The examinations were not ordered because the applicant withdrew his requests. On 13 June 2000 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court dismissed the applicant's action as unsubstant	[3]	2	1	0
7	 The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in Eger. In 1990 the applicant hired two individuals to construct a well for him. Since they had not completed the work in due time, in December 1990 he brought an action with a view to obliging them to complete the job. In the alternative, he claimed damages. In response to the applicant’s motion for bias, the Supreme Court appointed the Mezőkövesd District Court to hear the case. After having held several hearings and obtained the opinion of an expert, on 27 September 1994 this court dismissed the applicant’s action. In pursuit of the applicant’s repeated motion for bias, the Supreme Court appointed the Hajdú-Bihar County Regional Court to deal with his appeal. On 11 October 1995 that court quashed the District Court’s decision and remitted the case. On 11 June 1996 the Supreme Court appointed the Debrecen District Court to hear the case in the resumed proceedings. After having held several hearings and 	[3]	3	1	0
8	 Under a contract of indefinite duration dated 25 August 1980, the applicant was appointed by the State of Kuwait as accountant in the Kuwaiti embassy in Paris.

9	 The applicant was born in 1947 and lived in Plovdiv. At the relevant time the applicant was the head of the criminal police force in one of the districts of Plovdiv. On 15 September 1999 his superior ordered an internal inquiry against him and a search of his office in connection with his alleged failure to note down a complaint concerning a serious offence. On 24 September 1999 three police officers searched the applicant’s office, including his safe. They made a record of almost all the items found in the safe and seized them, despite the applicant’s protests that some of those items – jewellery and money – were his and his family’s personal belongings which he kept in the safe because he was afraid to leave them at home. The officers refused to give the applicant a copy of the record. It is unclear whether it was presented to him for signature. On 14 February 2000 a criminal investigation was instituted in respect of the applicant on suspicion of hel	[3]	3	1	0
10	 The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Rijeka. He is a lawyer by profession. On 7 July 2010 while driving his car near Vrogorac, Croatia, the applicant was stopped by a police officer alleging that he had dangerously overtaken another car and that he had inappropriate tyres on his car. The police officer drew up a report on the incident. On 6 October 2010 the applicant received a penalty notice (obvezni prekršajni nalog) dated 12 July 2010 and issued by the Dubrovnik-Neretvanska Police Department (Policijska uprava Dubrovačko-neretvanska; hereinafter: “the police”) which stated that he had committed the minor offences of dangerously overtaking another car under section 12 of the Road Traffic Safety Act, and driving a car with inappropriate tyres under section 236 of the same Act, fining him with 1,500 Croatian kunas (HRK).

11	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Cricova, Chişinău. On 5 March 1997 he was arrested on a charge of complicity in an aggravated robbery. On 22 July 1997 the Buiucani District Court convicted the applicant of conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery and, as a dangerous recidivist, sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment, to be served in a labour camp with a severe regime. The applicant appealed against this decision. On 20 November 1997 the Chişinău Regional Court dismissed the appeal as unfounded and upheld the decision of the District Court. The applicant lodged an appeal in cassation against this decision. Following an oral hearing on 12 February 1998, the Appellate Court, in its final judgment, dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the Regional Court. The applicant lodged an application with the European Court on 28 April 1999. On 2 August 1999, he wrote to the Court, which had requested various documents from him, enclosing a 	[]	2	1	0
12	 The applicant was born in 1936 and lived in Ryazan, the Russian Federation. He died on 1 August 2005. By letter of 14 January 2006, Mrs Movsesyan, the applicant's widow, informed the Court that she wished to pursue the application. On 26 November 2001 the Pavlograd Court (Павлоградський районний суд Дніпропетровської області) awarded the applicant a lump sum of UAH 9,114.31[1] in various payments and UAH 416.61[2] in monthly disability allowances against his former employers, the State-owned companies “Dniproshakhtobud” (ДВАТ “Дніпрошахтобуд”), “Kryvbasshakhtoprokhodka” (трест “Кривбасшахтопроходка”) and “Rudoupravlinnya Kirova” (ДП “Рудоуправління ім. Кірова”). The judgment came into force and the enforcement writs were transferred to the Bailiffs' Service for enforcement. On 12 and 23 April 2002 the Bailiffs' Service informed the applicant that the judgment could not be enforced due to the considerable number of enforcement proceedings taken against the debtors 	[3, 9]	3	1	0
13	 The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Elblag. In 2009 the applicant was serving a prison sentence. On 8 March 2009 he applied for a stay of the execution of his sentence. On 8 June 2009 a penitentiary judge, E.O., refused the application. On 18 June 2009 the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against that decision. In his appeal, the applicant referred to a paragraph in the decision in which the judge had referred to his wife’s situation instead of his mother’s. The relevant part of the applicant’s appeal read as follows: “As to page 3 of the reasoning of the decision, I claim that E.O. must have drafted it under the influence of intoxicating substances, for instance alcohol or other narcotic substances. (...) [H]is mental functions being impaired, I therefore request the Court of Appeal to examine the capacity of that judge to decide cases.” On 24 June 2009 his appeal was rejected for failure to comply with the relevant time-limit. <	[3]	2	1	0

15	 The applicant was born in 1935 and lives in the village of Kresty in the Tula Region. On 20 October 1993 the applicant sued the Chernskiy District Social Security Services for pension arrears, an increase of his monthly pension and compensation for damage. On 16 December 1993 the Chernskiy District Court accepted the action in full. The judgment was quashed on 1 February 1994 and the case was remitted for a fresh examination. On 15 June 1998 the Chernskiy District Court partly accepted the applicant's action and decided to determine his claim concerning compensation for damage in separate proceedings. The Social Services appealed against the judgment to the Tula Regional Court. The first appeal hearing was fixed for 27 August 1998. However, it was adjourned until 6 October 1998 because the respondent did not attend. On 6 October 1998 the Tula Regional Court quashed the judgment of 15 June 1998 and remitted the case for a fresh examinatio	[3]	3	1	0
16	 The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Naklo. On 12 August 1993 the applicant was dismissed by his employer MC due to economic reasons. On 17 September 1993 the MC’s Complaints Commission rejected his complaint concerning the dismissal. On 15 October 1993 the applicant instituted proceedings against MC in the Ljubljana Court of Associated Labour (Sodišče združenega dela v Ljubljani) seeking the annulment of the MC’s first and second instance decisions concerning his dismissal. On 28 June 1994 the Convention entered into force with respect to Slovenia. According to the information supplied by the Government, five hearings were held between 23 September 1994 and 29 November 1995. The hearing held on 15 March 1995 was adjourned due to the absence of parties and the court subsequently decided to suspend the proceedings. At the request of the applicant, the proceedings continued after 17 July 1995. At the last hearing, the (renamed) Ljubljana Labour and Social Cour	[]	2	1	0
17	 The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Tychy. On 13 July 2000 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed burglary. On 15 July 2000 the Tychy District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a period of three months in view of the strong suspicion that he had committed five counts of burglary. It considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would tamper with evidence, given the fact that he had only partly confessed. Further, the court referred to the risk that the applicant might obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings by going into hiding. In that regard, the court relied on evidence from one of the applicant’s co-suspects, who had stated that, shortly before having been arrested, the applicant had tried to leave for Germany in order to evade serving a sentence of imprisonment which had been previously imposed on him. Finally, the court had regard to the severity of th	[2]	1	1	0
18	 The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Novoaltaysk, in the Altay region. In 1987 the General Secretary of the USSR Communist Party Mikhail Gorbachev presented his “basic theses”, which laid the political foundation for economic reform heralding the transition to a market economy. Several laws were enacted which opened up the State-dominated planned economy to private enterprise. However, the Government preferred to keep control over consumer prices rather than leaving them to be determined by the free market. By 1990 Government spending increased sharply as a growing number of unprofitable enterprises required State support, whereas more resources were diverted to subsidise consumer prices. At the same time, the elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer-goods sector, led to a breakdown in traditional supply-demand relationships. This resulted in pervasive shortages of food and basic consumer goods. The Government rea	[9]	2	1	0
19	 The applicant was born in 1931 and lives in Zagreb. In 1994 the applicant’s weekend house in Karlobag, Croatia, was blown up by unknown perpetrators. On 12 May 1995 the applicant instituted civil proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) seeking damages from the Republic of Croatia for his damaged property. Pursuant to the Civil Obligations (Amendments) Act 1996 (Zakon o izmjeni Zakona o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette no. 7/1996 of 26 January 1996), the Zagreb Municipal Court stayed the proceedings on 2 April 1996. On 25 November 2002 the applicant complained about the stay on his proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court to the Constitutional Court. It would appear that the proceedings before the Constitutional Court are still pending. The proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court resumed on an uncertain date pursuant to the “Damage from Terrorist Acts and Public Demonstrations Act 2003” (Zako	[3]	3	1	0

On 14 January 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody by police officers from the Anti-Terror branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). On 23 January 1995 he was brought before a single judge of the Izmir State Security Court who ordered his detention on remand. On 13 February 1995 the principal public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with the latter charging the applicant under Article 125 of the Criminal Code with carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory. On 2 December 1998 the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to death under Article 125 of the Criminal Code.

On 26 December 1994 the applicant was brought before the investigating judge at the Istanbul Magistrate’s Court, who ordered his detention on remand. On 2 January 1995 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Istanbul 7th Criminal Court against the applicant and three co-accused (O.I., M.T. and N.S.), requesting that they be punished for committing forgery under Articles 503 § 1 and 522 of the Criminal Code. The public prosecutor further decided that the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants (Memurin Muhakemeti Kanunu) did not apply to this case as the offence was ordinary. On 24 January 1995 the 7th Criminal Court commenced the proceedings. On 3	[3]	2	1	0

On 19 March 2003 the head of the Committee for Public Relations and Mass Media of the Yekaterinburg town administration acknowledged receipt of the notice. He noted that, should the picket cause any inconvenience, such as blocking access to the court-house or impairing its normal functioning, the administration would have to intervene.

In March 2002 the applicant, an officer in the Uzbek Armed Forces, left his military unit in Uzbekistan and went to Russia for employment-related reasons. He settled in the town of Yasnogorsk, in the Tula Region, some thirty kilometres to the north of Tula. Two years later his spouse and their two children, born in 1994 and 2000, moved over from Uzbekistan and subsequently obtained Russian citizenship. In 2007 the applicant’s spouse bought a house in Yasnogorsk. Until 2007, for unspecified reasons, the applicant lived separately from his spouse and children. On 30 July 2009 the Uzbek Ministry of Health recommended, at the applicant’s spouse’s request, that their elder daughter be admitted to a neurological hospital in Moscow in order to treat her neurological condition. The certificate stated that the child should be accompanied by her mother. The applicant did not 	[2]	2	1	0
27	 The applicant was born in 1955 and is currently in Aachen Prison. On 7 May 1993 the Bochum Regional Court convicted the applicant of sexual assault and sexual abuse of a minor committed in 1992. It sentenced him to three years and six months' imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention pursuant to Article 66 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 26-27 below). The court found that the applicant had sexually assaulted and abused a thirteen-year-old boy who, after having drunk alcoholic beverages with the applicant in front of the Bochum train station, had agreed to spend the night in the applicant's apartment for fear of disputes with his mother. The court, having consulted a medical expert, considered that the applicant had acted with full criminal responsibility. He suffered from a dissocial personality disorder which was characterized notably by a lack of feelings of guilt. That disorder did not, however, amount to an illness diminishing his criminal responsibility. 	[2]	2	1	1
28	 The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in San Giovanni Lupatoto (Verona). G.S., the applicant's father, was the owner of a flat in Cagliari which he had let to G.A.S. In a registered letter of 3 June 1991, the applicant's father informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1991 and asked him to vacate the premises by that date. In a writ served on the tenant on 24 February 1992, the applicant's father reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Cagliari Magistrate. By a decision of 23 March 1992, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Cagliari Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 28 June 1992. On 20 July 1992, the applicant's father served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises. On an unspecified date, the applicant's father made a statuto	[3, 9]	3	1	1
29	 The applicant, who was born in 1936, lives in Petrinja, Croatia. The applicant was the owner of a house in Petrinja where he had lived until August 1995 when he left Croatia due to military actions in that area. On 23 September 1995 Parliament enacted a law providing that the property of persons who left Croatia was to be taken into possession of the State. It also entitled the local authorities temporarily to accommodate refugees and displaced persons in such property. On 24 March 1997 the Petrinja local authorities gave the applicant’s house to Z.L. and M.L. (“the occupants”) for temporary use because their house had been destroyed during the war. On 10 June 1998 the applicant obtained a judgment from the Petrinja Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Petrinji) ordering the occupants to vacate his house within fifteen days. The judgment became final on 30 September 1998 when the Sisak County Court (Županijski sud u Sisku) dismissed the occupants’ app	[3, 9]	3	1	0

In September 1999, the applicant retired from the army. Upon retirement, the applicant was entitled to compensation for his uniform and to reimbursement of his travel expenses. As this compensation remained unpaid for three months, the applicant instituted proceedings in the Donetsk Garrison Military Court against the Donetsk Regional Military Registration Department (Донецкий Областной Военный Комиссариат), seeking recovery of the debt. On 12 January 2000, the court found for the applicant (Решение Военного суда Донецкого гарнизона) and awarded him UAH 2,576.72[1] for the uniform and UAH 128.77[2] for travel expenses.

The Tarnów Regional Prosecutor objected to that request. On 22 March 2000 the Tarnów Regio	[2]	2	1	0
96	 The applicant, Mr Adam Jarkiewicz, is a Polish national who was born in 1971 and lives Warszawa. On 24 April 2005 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of drug trafficking. On 26 April 2005 the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody. The applicant did not appeal against that decision. The inquiry against the applicant was initially conducted by the Warsaw District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy). It appears that a few months after the applicant's arrest the Lublin Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okręgowy) opened another inquiry against the applicant, who was suspected of further drug-related offences. As a consequence, the Lublin Regional Prosecutor took over the Warsaw case. The applicant's pre-trial detention was extended by the Warsaw District Court on 14 July 2005 (decision upheld on 13 September 2005), by the Lublin District Court on 19 October 2005 (upheld on 1 December 2005) and 6 January 2006 (upheld	[2, 4]	2	1	0
97	 The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Bucharest. On 31 July 2002 she lodged a criminal complaint against her husband accusing him of stealing from their common household. A civil claim was joined to the complaint. On 17 June 2003 the prosecution brought the case to court on charges of theft between spouses. On 16 February 2004 the Galaţi District Court convicted the defendant to two years and two months’ imprisonment and awarded the applicant 20,000 Romanian lei (RON) – around 4,500 euros (EUR) – as pecuniary damage. The judgment became final at first instance as no appeal had been filed against it. Subsequently, the defendant appealed on points of law outside the statutory time-limit alleging that the first-instance court had not observed the guarantees of a fair trial in his respect. He claimed that he had been convicted in absentia and that he had not benefited from legal representation. On 4 May 2005 the County Court 	[3]	2	1	0
98	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in the town of Orenburg. The applicant was in active military service between 1972 and 1998. In February 1998 while he was on leave he was refused a free plane ticket on account of the debt accrued by the Federal Ministry of Defence to the air carriers. The applicant purchased a ticket for himself expecting to be reimbursed by the employer later. After his retirement from active service, the applicant took paid leave in September 1998. Apparently, in March 1999 the military authority informed the applicant that he would not be reimbursed for the ticket he had bought in February 1998 because he was entitled to only one period of paid leave per year. It appears that in May 2001 the applicant brought civil proceedings in the Leninskiy District Court of Yekaterinburg claiming compensation in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the above refusal. Apparently, the District Court dismissed his 	[3]	2	1	0

In November 2003 the Budapest I/XII District Public Prosecutor charged the applicant with disorderly conduct and vandalism, punishable by three years of imprisonment. The Budapest Central District Court held hearings on 22 January, 28 March and 28 April 2004. On the latter date it found the applicant guilty of vandalism and fined him 90,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 337 euros (EUR)). The District Court relied on documentary evidence, the opinion of an expert, and the testimony of witnesses and the applicant. The applicant appealed, seeking acquittal on the ground that the judgment was ill-founded, and requested the court to hold a public hearing. The Budapest Chief prosecutor also appealed, and requested the court to quash the first-instance judgment and remit the case to the District Court because of shortcomings in the finding of facts. The Budapest Regional Court notified the a	[3]	2	1	0

Subsequently he was committed to stand trial by the Glinkovskiy District Court of the Smolensk Region. The trial was fixed for 22 July 2003. In the morning of 22 July 2003 the applicant had a talk with legal-aid counsel appointed to represent him. He was dissatisfied with the result of that discussion and so refused counsel's services in writing. The first witness on the stand was the applicant's sister. The applicant had an altercation with her and the judge ordered that he be escorted out of the room. The applicant was brought back into the courtroom to make his final submissions. After that the judge declared the trial at an end and announced that the verdict would be handed down on 24 July 2003. On 24 July 2003 the judge delivered the judgment, finding the applicant	[3]	2	1	0
101	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Kyiv. The circumstances of the case and court proceedings relate to a labour dispute between the applicant and his former employer, the State Patent Agency (“the Agency”, Держпатент). On 1 September 1998 the applicant was dismissed from the Agency. On 23 September 1998 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Shevchenkivsky District Court of Kyiv (“Shevchenkivsky Court”) against the Agency seeking reinstatement and claiming salary arrears and related payments. On 21 October 1998 the court allowed his claims. Consequently, the applicant was reinstated. The Agency appealed. On 24 February 1999 the judgment of 21 October 1998 was quashed by the Kyiv City Court and the case was remitted for fresh consideration. The judgment resulted in cancellation of the first instance court’s finding that the applicant was dismissed illegally. On 4 March 1999 the applicant was dismissed again. On 10 	[3]	2	1	0
102	 The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Istanbul. On 12 November 1999 he was arrested on suspicion of setting up a criminal organisation, namely the Bilim Araştırma Vakfı (Foundation for Science and Research). On the same day he went through a medical examination at the Haseki Research Hospital. The medical report drafted following that examination noted that there was no sign of ill-treatment on his body. During his time at police custody, on 15 November 1999, the applicant was examined once more, this time at the Şişli Etfal Research Hospital. The second report drawn up there also indicated that there existed no sign of ill-treatment on his body. The applicant was released on 17 November 1999. Immediately after his release, he went through two more medical examinations at two different institutions, namely the Vakıf Gureba Hospital and the Forensic Medicine Institute. The reports drawn up after each examination indicated once again the lack of any s	[1, 3]	2	1	0

By two medical reports of 26 July 1995 and 2 February 1996 the applicant was found to have sustained minor injuries. On an unspecified date the criminal case was opened against K. and subsequently referred to the Yavoriv Town Court (“the Yavoriv court”). In the course of the trial the applicant introduced a claim for compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages on account of his injuries. On 7 March 1997 the applicant received from a private dentist an estimate of the medical treatment which he had to undergo as a result of his injuries, and submitted it to the court. On 16 December 1997 the court found K. guilty of intentional infliction of minor bodily injuries and sentenced him to one year’s community service. It relied on the medical reports of 26 July 199	[3]	2	1	0
104	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Poznań. On 14 April 1999 the applicant was detained on suspicion of robbery and deprivation of liberty with aggravated violence. On 15 April 1999 the Wałcz District Prosecutor’s Office requested the Wałcz District Court to remand the applicant in custody. He indicated that the crimes the applicant was charged with had been committed with exceptional cruelty and that there was a risk that he would influence the witnesses and his co-accused if released. On 15 April 1999 the Wałcz District Court remanded the applicant in custody for 3 months. In its decision the court underlined that there was a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the crimes and, moreover, had done so soon after he had been released from prison. In addition, since the applicant was charged with a crime against a person who had refused to testify in his favour, the court considered that there was a reasonable fear that the applicant w	[]	1	1	0

The tax inspection was concluded with a final report on 20 December 2005. On 25 August and 12 September 2006 the tax authorities imposed on the applicant additional taxes as well as tax surcharges (veronkorotus, skatteförhöjning) for the tax years 2000 to 2003 as he had, inter alia, received disguised dividends from the companies. The amount of tax surcharges varied between 240 and 5,000 euros (EUR). By letter dated 16 September 2008 the applicant sought rectification from the local Tax Rectification Committee (verotuksen oikaisulautakunta, prövningsnämnden i beskattningsärenden), requesting it to quash the decisions of 25 August and 12 September 2006 concerning the tax years 2002 to 2003.

106	 The applicant is a freelance journalist who lives in Vienna. From 1992 to 1995 he was the editor of the official magazine of the Vienna Jewish community. In the beginning of 1995 the Academy of the Austrian Freedom Party (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs) published an article in its yearbook, written by P., a professor of political sciences at Münster University. The article was entitled “Internationalism against nationalism: an eternal mortal enmity?” and alleged that the Jews had declared war on Germany in 1933. Moreover, it trivialised the crimes of the Nazi regime. In February 1995 the applicant published a commentary on this article in the magazine of the Vienna Jewish community. It was entitled “Freedom Party's 1995 yearbook with (neo-)Nazi tones”. He criticised P. in harsh terms for using Nazi terminology and disseminating ideas which were typical of the “Third Reich”. More specifically, he accused P. of reviving the old Nazi lie of a worldwide Jewish consp	[4]	0	1	1

Between 1 February 1961 and 31 May 1981 the applicant paid contributions to the Fund of Typographers and Graphic-Arts Employees for 4,246 working days. Between 1 May 1979 and 30 July 1981 he paid contributions to the Social Security Fund for Technical Staff working in the Athens Press for twenty months and six days. Between 1 August 1981 and 9 May 1988 he paid contributions to the same fund for six years, eight months and three days. Then the applicant requested to be put on retirement under sections 18 § 2 and 10 § 1 of Law no. 1186/81. According to that law, persons who had contributed for at least five years to the Social Security Fund for Technical Staff working in the Athens Press were entitled to a pension if they were made redundant out of no fault of their own or because of the introduction of new technology. Those who had contributed for five to ten years would receive a monthly pension of GRD 10,000. A higher am	[3]	2	1	1

She stated that she had met the applicant that afternoon in a public house. After visiting further pubs she had accompanied him to his rented room where, she alleged, he had attempted to rape her. On 21 March 2001 Mrs K was again questioned by the police and criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant. Between 1.04 p.m. and 3.16 p.m. on 18 April 2001 Mrs K was questioned by the investigating judge in the presence of the applicant, his lawyer, a psychiatric expert Mr H and the court stenographer. The applicant and his lawyer were given the opportunity to put questions to Mrs K and the hearing was recorded on video.

On 15 April 1992 a certain company U submitted a bill of exchange in the amount of PLN 50,000 signed by the applicant and requested the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) to issue an order for payment against him and other partners in the civil association K (spółka cywilna). On 9 June 1992 the court made the order for payment, allowing the plaintiff’s application. The applicant lodged an appeal against that order. Subsequently, the applicant applied for exemption from the court fees. On 4 July 1996 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) finally allowed his application. The Warsaw Regional Court scheduled hearings for 22 May, 18 September, 23 October and 24 November 1997. However, all of them were adjourned. Between 8 December 1997 and 18 May 1998 five hearings were adjourned. On 18 June 1998 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment in which it upheld the Warsaw District Court’s	[3]	2	1	0

On 12 November 2002 his pre-trial detention was ordered. On 2 May 2003 he was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. While he was serving this sentence in a Spanish prison, he was granted a leave, from which he did not return. Subsequently, he absconded. It appears that simultaneously another investigation was in progress on the side of the Hungarian authorities who suspected that the applicant and his Hungarian common-law wife were involved in a drug trafficking network operating between Spain, Hungary and South America. In this context, a European arrest warrant was issued by the Hungarian Miskolc District Court. Acting upon this warrant, the Spanish police arrested the applicant on 8 August 2005.

On 3 June 2002 the court awarded the applicant UAH 50,822.44[1]. On 9 July 2002 the enforcement proceedings were initiated. In September 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Dobropolsky Town Court against the Dobropolsky Town Bailiffs’ Service for failure to enforce the judgment of 3 June 2002 expeditiously. On 18 October 2002 the court found for the applicant and ordered the Bailiffs to enforce the judgment immediately. By 7 December 2004 the judgment in the applicant’s favour was enforced in full and the Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings on that date.	[3, 9]	2	1	0

On 5 September 2000, at the age of 13 he arrived in the United Kingdom from Nigeria, where he was granted entry clearance together with his two sisters to join their mother, who had resided for four years in the United Kingdom and was working as a nurse. The applicant has not seen his father since 1991, when the latter abandoned the family. Prior to arriving in the United Kingdom, he resided with his elderly maternal grandfather in a town a day’s travel from Lagos. On 27 September 2002, at the age of 15, the applicant was convicted of the rape, together with a group of other boys, of a 13 year-old girl.

He claimed that he was in need of assistance and had additional costs due to a speech impediment caused by a laryngectomy operation in 1979. By a decision of 24 April 1987 the Social Insurance Office (försäkringskassan; hereinafter “the Office”) of the County of Västmanland rejected the application, finding that the applicant’s needs or costs were not such as to make him eligible for disability benefits. On 27 December 1990 the applicant requested the Office to review its decision under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act. He claimed that he had failed to fully state his need of assistance and his additional costs in the original application.

However, he could not move in because another person, Mrs H., was living there. The applicant applied to a court for an eviction order. On 25 June 2002 the Tsentralniy District Court of Sochi found for the applicant and held that he should move into room no. 28, whereas Mrs H. and her family should move to a new flat which would be provided by the Sochi Town Council and the municipal enterprise “REO Obshchezhitiy g. Sochi” (the entity in charge of operation and maintenance of Sochi dormitories). On 13 August 2002 the Krasnodar Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal.

They accordingly informed the investigator from the regional prosecutor’s office who was in charge of the investigation into Ch.’s death. The investigator asked the officers to arrest both suspects. On 25 May 2006 the FSB officer D. telephoned the applicant and asked him to come over to the FSB premises to make a photocopy of his passport. On the same day M., a friend of the applicant’s, drove the applicant to the FSB office. The applicant entered the FSB premises at about noon. M. waited for him for about two hours and then drove off.

While riding a bicycle on work-related business on 21 January 2000, the applicant suffered a heart attack which caused him to fall. About two weeks later, he also suffered a cerebral stroke. On 2 April 2001 he reported the accident to the Social Insurance Office (Försäkringskassan) of the County of Södermanland which granted him early retirement pension as from 1 December 2001. The applicant also requested the Social Insurance Office to grant him life annuity (livränta) but, on 28 April 2003, the Social Insurance Office rejected the request. It found that the applicant’s medical problems could not be regarded as work-related and that his ability to support himself by working was not sufficiently reduced as a result of the accident.

On 25 September 2000 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed burglary and having handled stolen goods. On 26 September 2000 the Katowice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that he be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question while acting in an organised criminal group, the severity of the anticipated sentence and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The latter ground was based on the risk that, once released, he might tamper with evidence. The applicant's appeal against the decision was dismissed on 11 October 2000 by the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy). On 15 January 2001 the District Court prolonged the applicant's detention.

On 3 January 2005 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and placed in a temporary detention facility at the Severo-Evensk District police station in the Magadan Region (ИВС Северо-Эвенского РУВД). According to the applicant, he was kept in a windowless cell without any other access to fresh air or daylight. It was dim and stuffy. There was no ventilation.

It found that in the light of the evidence obtained, in particular from his accomplices, there was a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed that offence. The court further observed that the applicant had not confessed and found that there was a risk that he might obstruct the investigation. Having regard to the severity of the penalty that could be expected, the court held that keeping the applicant in custody was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. That decision was upheld on appeal on 7 January 2000. On 8 March 2000 the Skierniewice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) prolonged the applicant’s detention until 10 June 200	[2, 4]	2	1	0
159	 The applicant was born in 1960. It appears that the applicant is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in the Stavropol Region, Russia. On an unspecified date and in unspecified circumstances, the applicant acquired 13.4 g of heroin and divided it into two parcels. On 20 August 2003 a Mr S. came to Obruchevskiy police station in Moscow and made a written statement indicating that he had met a Mr T., who had told him that a person of “Georgian origin” named Levan, around 40 years old, was a heroin supplier. S. expressed his readiness to assist the police in collecting evidence of Levan’s alleged criminal activities (see also paragraph 17 below). On the same date, referring to S.’s statement, Police Officer K. issued an order authorising a “test purchase” of drugs: “... [S.] stated that he had become acquainted with a person of Georgian origin; this man had offered him heroin for 600 roubles per gram. Their meeting is expected to take place today, wh	[1]	2	1	0
160	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in the town of Belitskoye, Donetsk region, Ukraine. On 24 April 1998 the Dobropolye Town Court ordered the Belitskaya Mine, a State enterprise, to pay the applicant UAH 15,675.40 in compensation for an occupational disability and for moral damage. The applicant failed to inform the Court whether he appealed against this judgment or not. In July 1998 the Dobropolye Town Bailiffs’ Service opened the enforcement proceedings. Between 1998 and 2003 the judgment was enforced in instalments, the final payment being transferred on 10 November 2003. On 12 November 2003 the Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings in view of the full enforcement of the judgment given in the applicant’s favour.	[3]	2	1	0
161	 The applicant was born in 1970. On an unspecified date in the second half of 1994 the applicant was arrested and detained in investigation detention facilities in Kyustendil and Sofia in the framework of a criminal investigation against him. On 25 November 1994 he was transferred to Pazardzhik Prison. On 11 July 1996 the Kyustendil Regional Court found the applicant guilty of a number of violent offences committed between May 1993 and August 1994 and sentenced him to death. On 4 February 1999 the Sofia Court of Appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction but, following the abolition of the death penalty with effect from 27 December 1998 and the concomitant introduction of the sentence of life imprisonment without commutation (see paragraph 30 below), replaced his sentence with life imprisonment without commutation. On 27 January 2000 the applicant was transferred from Pazardzhik Prison to Bobov Dol Prison, where he has been serving his sentence ever since. B	[1]	2	1	0
162	 The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in London. On 1 April 1998 the applicant, who is a journalist, distributed a leaflet concerning the conscientious objector Mr O.M.U, outside the Ankara State Security Court. He also handed the leaflet to the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court together with a petition stating that he should be prosecuted for having committed a crime. The leaflet, entitled “Freedom to think - an initiative against the crime of thought” contained the press release issued by O. M. U on 1 September 1995. The latter had been previously convicted and sentenced on account of this press release. The relevant parts of the leaflet are as follows: Preface and Epilogue: “...

163	 The applicant was born in 1978 and has a permanent address in Dublin. The criminal proceedings against the applicant to which this application relates arose, inter alia, from his association with the following events. On 10 October 2002, an off-duty Garda (police) detective attached to the Special Detective Unit - who lived in a housing estate near Dublin called Corke Abbey - noticed suspicious activity and contacted a local Garda station. From shortly after 11 pm, he watched the movements of three cars (a blue Nissan Almera, a dark Nissan Micra and a yellow Transit van) and he noticed the occupants of the three cars acting in what appeared to be a coordinated manner. At one stage, five men got out of the Nissan Micra and three of them got into the back of the yellow Transit van, where there was already a driver and a man in the passenger seat. The other two got back into the Nissan Micra and it was driven off. A taxi arrived and its sole passenger got out and joi	[]	1	1	1
164	 The applicant, a retired military officer, was born in 1932 and lives in Athens. On an unspecified date in 2001 he lodged an application with the State’s General Accounting Office (thereafter “Accounting Office”) asking the readjustment of his pension. On 10 January 2002 his request was dismissed (decision no. 45977/2002). On 16 May 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal with the State Audit Council (Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο) challenging the decision of the Accounting Office. The hearing took place on 3 June 2005. By judgment dated 7 October 2005 the State Audit Council upheld the applicant’s appeal and remitted the case to the Accounting Office (judgment no. 2047/2005). On 10 April 2006 the State lodged an appeal on points of law. The hearing took place on 7 May 2008. On 1st October 2008 the Plenary of the State Audit Council dismissed the appeal (judgment no. 2052/2008). The applicant was served with the decision on 11 December 2008.	[3]	3	1	1
165	 On 3 January 1997 the applicant appeared before the magistrates' court, charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and failing to answer bail. He was legally represented. The applicant elected to be tried in the Crown Court. The stipendiary magistrate therefore adjourned the proceedings to enable a committal hearing to take place at a later date and proceeded to consider whether the applicant should be granted bail. During the course of that consideration, the applicant “reacted adversely” in court, causing a disturbance which led the magistrate to conclude that there existed a future risk of a breach of the peace by him. The magistrate therefore made an order binding the applicant over to keep the peace and to be of good behaviour under the Justices of the Peace Act 1361. The applicant was “bound over” in his own recognisance of 50 pounds sterling (GBP) together with a surety of GBP 250. The precise terms of the order were found by the Divisional Court (in the la	[3]	0	1	1
166	 The applicant was born in 1960. He is currently detained in Isparta Prison. The applicant was suspected of being involved in an armed robbery. On 1 August 1996 police officers from the organised crime unit of the İstanbul Security Directorate conducted an operation and the applicant was arrested. At the time of his arrest, the applicant was at a real estate office, owned by one of his relatives. Many of his relatives, including his children, were in this office at the relevant time. The applicant was allegedly beaten severely on his neck and back during his arrest. He was subsequently taken to the Security Directorate Building in Gayrettepe, without having a medical examination. The applicant was allegedly blindfolded and interrogated in the security directorate building. During his interrogation, it is alleged that the applicant was stripped naked, punched, beaten with a truncheon, and had his testicles squeezed. However, the Government maintained that the applic	[1]	2	1	0
167	 The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Geneva. On 14 July 1939, before the applicant’s birth, the State-appointed guardian brought an action against A.H., the applicant’s putative biological father, seeking a declaration of paternity and payment of a contribution towards his maintenance. A.H. admitted that he had had sexual relations with the applicant’s mother but denied paternity. On 26 July 1939, after the applicant’s birth, his mother declared on registering the birth that the father was A.H., with whom she had had sexual relations during the period of conception. On 30 January 1948 the Geneva Court of First Instance dismissed the action for a declaration of paternity. In the absence of an appeal, the judgment became final. In 1958 the applicant, who had been placed with a foster family, met his mother, who informed him that his father was A.H. According to the applicant, he had regular contact with his father and received presents from 	[4]	3	1	1
168	 The applicant was born in 1986 and lives in Kaluga, the Russian Federation. On 10 July 2000 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Kirovsky District Court of Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine (the “District Court”; Кіровський районний суд м. Дніпропетровська) against Ms M., his relative, claiming part of an intestate house she had received after the death of their relatives. Subsequently the applicant amended his claims seeking additional monetary compensation. Between July 2000 and July 2001 the District Court scheduled twelve hearings, two of them being adjourned on account of the applicant's conduct (amendment of claims and failure to appear). Six hearings were adjourned on account of the defendant's failures to appear, or at her requests. Three hearings were adjourned in connection with various court matters. On 24 July 2001 the court heard the case in Ms M.'s absence and allowed the applicant's claims. Ms M. appealed. On 11 December 2001 th	[3]	1	1	0
169	 The applicant, an Iraqi Kurd, was born in 1976 and now lives and works as a doctor in London. In December 2000 the applicant fled the Kurdish Autonomous Region of Iraq when, in the course of his duties as a hospital doctor, he treated and facilitated the escape of three fellow members of the Iraqi Workers’ Communist Party who had been injured in an attack. He arrived at Heathrow Airport on 30 December 2000 and immediately claimed asylum. The immigration officer contacted the Oakington Reception Centre (“Oakington”, see paragraphs 23-25 below) but there was no immediate room there, so the applicant was granted “temporary admission” (see paragraphs 20-21 below) to stay at a hotel of his choice and return to the airport the following morning. On 31 December 2000 he reported as required and was again granted temporary admission until the following day. When the applicant again reported as required, he was, for the third time, granted temporary admission until 10 a.m	[2]	1	1	1
170	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Derik, Turkey. The case concerns the circumstances of the death of the applicant's brother, Mr Yakup Aktaş. According to his death certificate, Mr Yakup Aktaş, who was born in 1964, died in Mardin, Turkey, on 25 November 1990. He left a widow and also a daughter who had been born earlier that year. The applicant alleges that the death of Yakup Aktaş resulted from torture following his arrest. The Government deny this. The facts of the case being in dispute, the Commission appointed Delegates who took evidence in Ankara on 19 and 20 November 1997. They heard the applicant and the following witnesses: the applicant's brother Mr Mahmut Aktaş, the Public Prosecutor Şevki Artar, Professor Dr Özdemir Kolusayın, Dr Hüseyin Sarı and Dr Güneş Pay. On 18 November 1997, while evidence was being taken in a different case, the Acting Agent of the Government submitted that, for their security, ten members of the	[0, 1]	1	1	0
171	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Krasnokamsk, the Perm Region. On 23 May 1999 the applicant's son, born in 1981, was drafted into military service. On 17 October 1999 he was killed during military operations in Chechnya. In 2000 the applicant instituted proceedings for damages against the Ministry of Defence. She claimed that her son was sent to participate in military operations in breach of statutory provisions since he had only served for four months while it was only permitted to send for military operations servicemen who had served no less than 12 months. On 13 July 2001 the Krasnokamskiy Town Court granted the claim and awarded the applicant damages in the amount of 50,000 roubles (RUR) and costs in the amount of RUR 10. The judgment was not appealed against and became final. On 1 October 2001 a writ of execution was issued. On 9 November 2001 the applicant sent the writ of execution to the Moscow Department of Federal Treasury 	[3, 9]	2	1	0
172	 The applicant was born in 1971 in Baku and is currently serving a life sentence in Gobustan Prison. The applicant was sought by the law-enforcement authorities for complicity in a number of criminal offences, including two murders, committed in 1994. On 22 October 1998 the applicant was arrested in Russia and on 11 March 1999 he was extradited to Azerbaijan. On 24 January 2000 the Supreme Court, sitting as the court of first instance, convicted the applicant of complicity in two counts of murder, several counts of theft, illegal possession and sale of weapons, and hooliganism. The sentences for these offences were merged, and the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment and confiscation of property. Following his conviction, in January 2000 the applicant was transferred to the 5th wing of Bayil Prison, formerly designated for convicts sentenced to death. On 5 January 2001 he was transferred to Gobustan Prison, located outside Baku, 	[3]	2	1	0
173	 The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Košice. On 3 April 2001 the applicant filed an action with the Košice II District Court. He claimed that the defendants had lost the right to use a flat. The first hearing in the case was held on 21 September 2004. On 23 September 2004, on the applicant's complaint, the Constitutional Court found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the length of the above proceedings. It noted that the case was not complex. The applicant's conduct had partially contributed to their duration at the initial stage in that he had not paid the court fees at the time of filing the action. The District Court was responsible for delays totalling twenty-five months. The Constitutional Court awarded the applicant 20,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK) (the equivalent of 500 euros (EUR) at that time) as just satisfaction. It also ordered the District Court to reimburse the applicant's legal costs and to proceed with the ca	[3]	2	1	0
174	 The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Velenje. On 25 August 1994 the applicant was severely injured in an accident at work in a carpenters’ workshop. VE, the applicant’s employer, had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT. On 31 July 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against VE and ZT in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 10,337,422 tolars (approximately 43,000 euros) for the injuries sustained. He also sought an exemption from court fees. Between 30 December 1997 and 5 September 2001 the applicant lodged twenty-six preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence. Between 30 December 1997 and 3 January 2001 he made eight requests that a date be set for a hearing. Of the four hearings held between 18 January 1999 and 28 March 2002 none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. During the proceedings the court appointed commission of three medical experts and two additional	[3]	2	1	0
175	 The applicant was born in 1969 and is currently serving a prison sentence in the “TRNC”. On 29 May 2001 a businessman was found dead in his office in the “TRNC”. His throat had been slit and there were also a number of injuries to his head caused by blows. According to the autopsy report, the businessman had been killed in his office between 8 p.m. and 10.45 p.m. on 29 May 2001. The remaining facts of the case are disputed by the parties and are set out separately. The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in Section B below (paragraphs 9-22). The Government’s submissions concerning the facts are summarised in Section C below (paragraphs 23-32). The documentary evidence submitted by the applicant and the Government is summarised in Section D (paragraphs 33-46). The applicant, his wife and their two children moved to the “TRNC” in 1997 and the applicant opened two shops, selling musical equipment. The applicant did not speak much Turkish. 	[3]	2	1	0
176	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Hagen in Germany. The applicant was arrested on 8 April 2007. His identity papers proved to be forgeries. On 9 April 2007 the Hagen District Court (Landgericht) issued an arrest warrant against the applicant based on possession of forged documents. On 11 April 2007 the General Public Prosecutor took over the investigation. On 23 May 2007 the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) quashed the arrest warrant and issued a fresh arrest warrant based, inter alia, on the suspicion of membership of a foreign terrorist organisation (the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front, DHKP-C). On 21 June 2007 the Federal Court of Justice rejected the applicant’s appeal against the arrest warrant. On 30 August, 30 October 2007 and 14 February 2008 the Federal Court of Justice upheld the arrest warrant and ordered that the applicant’s detention be continued.

177	 The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Kurdzhali. On 20 June 1999 the applicant, while driving his car, was involved in a traffic accident with another car. Subsequently, the driver of the other car filed a complaint with the police, claiming that the applicant had made him sign a note for 3,000 German Marks (approximately EUR 1,538) for a non-existent debt. He maintained that the applicant had forced him into signing the document by threatening him verbally, with a firearm and by inflicting a light bodily injury. On 25 June 1999 the applicant was arrested, charged with extortion accompanied with a light bodily injury and using a firearm, and placed in pre-trial detention. The offence carried a possible sentence of two to eight years' imprisonment. It is unclear how long the preliminary investigation lasted and when an indictment against the applicant was submitted to the courts. On 13 September 1999 the applicant's defence counsel	[2]	1	1	0
178	 The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Kharkiv. In August 2003 F., a cashier in a game-machines arcade, was found at his workplace unconscious with head injuries. He died in hospital shortly afterwards. On 8 June 2004 the applicant was arrested by the Leninskiy District police of Kharkiv (“the district police”) and confessed to having inflicted injuries on F. and robbed the arcade. According to the applicant, that confession was false and had been given by him as a result of ill-treatment. In particular, police officers had applied electric current to his body, suffocated him in a gas mask and applied various other unspecified torture techniques. At an unspecified time on the date of the applicant’s arrest he was assigned a legal-aid lawyer, S. Also on the same date the applicant had a confrontation with two witnesses, who claimed that they had seen him running near the arcade, with his bare chest covered in mud and blood, on the day when F.

On 9 May 1998 he was brought before the public prosecutor and investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, who ordered his pre-trial detention. On 11 May 1998 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him with membership of an illegal organisation. On 14 July 1998 due to the factual and legal connection between the cases, the court decided to joint the applicant’s case to other proceedings, involving seven accused (no. 1998/2). On the same day the applicant was released pending trial. On 29 July 2000 a change took place in the judges sitting as a bench at the Istanbul State Security Court and therefore, the next hearing was scheduled on 7 September 2000.

On 20 June 2000 the applicant and two other persons were apprehended on suspicion of involvement in several incidents of theft. The applicant was allegedly taken to a flat where the police officers beat him up to make him confess to the crimes. On the next day he was transferred to a temporary detention facility at a police station. According to the applicant, the beatings continued on 21, 22, 23 and 26 June 2000. On 21, 22, 23 and 26 June 2000 in response to the applicant’s complaints of renal colic and pain in the lumbar area, the officer on duty called an ambulance. The applicant was examined on each occasion by a doctor, who did not find it necessary to take him to hospital. The applicant did not tell the doctor or the officer on duty anything as to what might have caused those pains. Nor did he say anything about ill-treatment by the police.

181	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Vilnius. At the time of lodging his application, he was serving a prison sentence. The applicant, a person with previous convictions, was suspected of robbery. On 8 September 1999 the police conducted a search of his home. The applicant complained to the prosecution that the search had been unlawful. He also alleged that the police had taken some documents and computer files belonging to the Belarusian Youth Association (BYA), a non-governmental organisation which he ran. On the same date the applicant was arrested. His detention on remand was authorised by the Vilnius City Third District Court on 10 September 1999. It was thereafter extended on several occasions. On 20 September 1999 the applicant was placed in custody at the Lukiškės Remand Prison (Vilniaus Lukiškių tardymo izoliatorius - kalėjimas). He unsuccessfully attempted to escape from a convoy vehicle on 28 December 1999. On 23 Dece	[1, 4]	2	1	0

They did not live together but often used to spend the night over each other’s house. Towards the end of their relationship they started to have disputes because O.P. became very jealous. According to the applicant he also became violent. On the evening of 10 May 2010 O.P. became upset with the applicant because she was not at home for several hours and did not answer his telephone calls. He waited for her in front of her home and when she arrived he assaulted her and forced into his car. The applicant’s attempts to escape were countered by O.P.’s violent behaviour and threats with violence and death. According to the applicant, he punched her, pulled her hair and threatened her every time she wanted to leave the car. O.P. denied the applicant’s allegations concerning the acts of violence and only admitted having slapped her face several times bef	[1]	1	1	0

He was placed in the temporary detention facility of the Nevskiy District of St Petersburg. On 20 May 2004 the Nevskiy District Court of St Petersburg (“the trial court”) remanded the applicant in custody. He was transferred to remand prison IZ-47/1 in St Petersburg (“the remand prison”). The court held that the applicant was charged with a serious crime, had a disposition to commit crimes and could continue to pursue criminal activities if at liberty. The ruling was not appealed against. On 15 July 2004 the Kuybyshevskiy District Court of St Petersburg granted a request by the investigator to extend the applicant's detent	[1, 2]	2	1	0
184	 The applicant was born in 1973. He is serving a prison term in Ilava prison. On 14 October 2003 the applicant lodged an action with the Nitra District Court. He claimed that the defendant should be ordered to apologise for statements accusing the applicant of an offence and to pay compensation. On 28 May 2004 the case-file was transmitted to the Pieštany District Court due to local jurisdiction. That court exempted the applicant from the obligation to pay court fees on 6 September 2004. It obtained a statement from the defendant on 15 October 2004. On 23 June 2005 the case-file was transmitted to the Trnava District Court due to reorganisation of the judicial system. In the course of 2006 and the first half of 2007 it examined the applicant’s situation in view of his request for exemption from court fees.

185	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Kingisepp, Leningrad Region. On 8 March 2001 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of extortion. In 2001 the applicant complained several times to a local prosecutor about the alleged unlawfulness of his detention. It appears that he never received any reply. On 19 November 2001 the preliminary investigation was completed. On 29 November 2001 the investigator allegedly interrupted the examination of the case file by the applicant and his lawyer. Numerous complaints by the applicant in this respect to the prosecutor’s office were of no avail. On 19 April 2002 the Kingisepp Town Court, following adversarial proceedings in the course of which many witnesses including co-defendants and victims gave evidence, convicted the applicant of extortion and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment.

On 18 December 2000 the applicant requested the Regional Pension Office (Landesversicherungsanstalt Niederbayern-Oberpfalz) (“the Pension Office”) to grant him a pension on account of his reduced earning capacity (Rente wegen verminderter Erwerbsfähigkeit). On 9 March 2001 the Pension Office dismissed his request. On 26 April 2001 the Pension Office dismissed the applicant's administrative appeal lodged on 2 April 2001. On 4 July 2001 the applicant appealed to the Landshut Social Court. On 2 August 2001 the Pension Office made its submissions. However, it sent the required medical records only on 5 November 2001. Between 5 November 2001 and 21 March 2003 no progress was made in the proceedings.

In the context of a police investigation concerning a murder and robbery which took place on 19 April 2000, the police contacted the applicant’s father and invited him and the applicant to visit the Limassol police station. At the time the applicant was just over 17 years old. The applicant went to the police station accompanied by his father. The Limassol District Police Director (hereinafter “the Police Director”) informed the applicant’s father, in the presence of the applicant, about the crime that had been committed, the seriousness of the case, and the fact that there was evidence involving the applicant and that an arrest warrant had been issued against him.

On 24 July 1997, when the applicant, a minor at the time, was playing in the yard near home and climbed the concrete wall surrounding the Dzhankoy State Boarding School (the “School”; Джанкойська республіканська загальноосвітня школа-інтернат), a concrete slab from the wall, weighing 1,500 kg, fell on him. The applicant survived, but became permanently and severely disabled. According to the applicant, between 1997 and 1999 his parents lodged numerous unsuccessful requests for investigation into the accident, however, he did not submit any relevant documents predating 7 June 1999.

202	 Between 4 July 1998 and 1 April 1999 a series of robberies and burglaries took place in the Coventry area. As a result of their investigations, the police considered that there were some nine persons involved in the commission of these offences, including the applicant and his three co-defendants. The police had difficulty obtaining evidence against those who they thought were responsible, and therefore decided to seek authority from the Chief Constable for the West Midlands to carry out a covert operation (“Operation Brassica”). The operation was to be carried out by arresting the suspects in groups, on suspicion of having committed different offences, and detaining them together in a police cell which had been specially fitted with covert audio equipment. It was hoped that the suspects would discuss the reasons for their arrest and that their ensuing conversation would be incriminating. On 17 May 1999 the Chief Constable gave authority for Operation Brassica to take place. 	[4]	0	1	1

On 29 April 2005 the Katowice District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. The court referred to the complexity of the case and the considerable number of accused. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence and induce witnesses to give false testimony.

His family had owned considerable immovable property in northern Cyprus and was one of the wealthiest families in the village. The applicant's parents had intended to transfer to him a quarter share in their immovable properties when he reached the age of 18. However, because of the 1974 Turkish intervention this did not happen. The applicant considered that, even though the formal registration process was not completed, he had been the “beneficial owner” of the said share in the properties from the age of 18.

222	 The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Michalovce. The applicant was married. The marriage produced two children: a daughter who was born in 1997 and a son who was born in 2001. On 2 November 2002 the applicant filed a criminal complaint against her husband with the Michalovce District Police Department (Obvodné oddelenie Policajného zboru). She accused him of having assaulted and beaten her with an electric cable the previous day. She submitted a medical report by a trauma specialist indicating that her injuries would incapacitate her from work for up to seven days. The applicant also stated that there was a long history of physical and psychological abuse by her husband. At an unspecified time between 15 and 18 November 2002 the applicant and her husband went to the District Police Station. They sought to withdraw the applicant's criminal complaint. A police officer, Mr H., advised them that, in order to avoid a prosecution, they would have to prod	[0]	1	1	0
223	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Rózsaszentmárton. In 1991 the applicant was diagnosed with manic depression. On 27 May 2005 he was placed under partial guardianship. Although this measure was based on the Civil Code which deals with the pecuniary and certain personal relations of citizens (see paragraph 12 below), it nevertheless also attracted the application of Article 70(5) of the Constitution (see paragraph 11 below) to the applicant, excluding him from the right to vote. In the underlying court decision it was noted that he took care of himself adequately but sometimes wasted money in an irresponsible fashion and was occasionally aggressive. The applicant did not appeal against this decision. On 13 February 2006 the applicant realised that he had been omitted from the electoral register drawn up in view of the upcoming legislative elections. His complaint to the Electoral Office was to no avail. The applicant further complained to the Pes	[]	2	1	0
224	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Obninsk in the Kaluga Region. In 1987 the applicant took part in emergency operations at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster. Since 1994, when the link was established between his disability and his involvement in the Chernobyl events, the applicant has been in receipt of monthly health damage compensation. He brought proceedings against the Obninsk town pension authority to challenge the amount of the compensation. On 20 January 2000 the Obninsk Town Court of the Kaluga Region (“the Town Court”) granted the applicant’s claim and ordered the pension authority to make monthly compensation payments of 3,161.19 Russian roubles (RUR) and pay him the outstanding compensation in the amount of RUR 20,082.86. The judgment was upheld by the Kaluga Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) and came into force on 6 April 2000. On 7 June 2000 the Town Court issued two writs of execution, for the monthly co	[3, 9]	2	1	0
225	 The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Kovachevets. In 1995 the applicant entered into contracts under which he undertook to export wheat to foreign companies. On 11 August 1995 the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria adopted Regulation No. 160/1995 whereby the export tax for wheat was increased from 35 United States dollars (USD) to USD 55. The new rate became effective on 25 August 1995. On 24 August 1995 the applicant had already loaded 6,333 metric tons of wheat on to a cargo ship. At 11.30 p.m. on the same day he submitted to the customs authorities in the port of Varna West the necessary customs documents. However, the applicant was not granted authorisation to export the shipment. Thereafter, he continued loading the ship and later paid the export tax at the newly-introduced higher rate, whereupon export authorisation was granted. On 8 October 1996 the applicant brought an action for damages against the Central Customs Office (Главно управление „	[3]	2	1	0
226	 In 1986 the applicant took part in the emergency operation at the Chernobyl nuclear plant. As a result he suffered from extensive exposure to radioactive emissions. The applicant underwent medical examinations which established the link between his poor health and his involvement in the Chernobyl events. He was consequently granted status of a disabled person and awarded a monthly pension and a special allowance from the State, to be adjusted once a year in line with the minimum subsistence amount (величина прожиточного минимума). At a certain moment in 2001 the social security authorities ceased to increase regularly the amounts of pension and allowance, paid to the applicant in connection with his disability. Instead, he started to receive his pension in a fixed amount (2,800 Roubles), which was less than he expected. Presuming that this practice was illegal, the applicant brought proceedings against the regional social security office (“the defendant”) claiming the incr	[3, 9]	0	1	0
227	 The applicant, a Russian national of Chechen origin, was born in 1976 and lives in Vienna. The applicant left Chechnya for Kyrgyzstan and Poland in April 2004, with his mother. They arrived in Austria in November 2004 and lodged an asylum request there. He claimed in his asylum proceedings that in 2001 his father had been shot before his eyes. The applicant’s father had worked in the security services of former President Maskhadov, a separatist leader, which was why he and his family had been persecuted. Furthermore, the applicant had been arrested four times and only released after the payment of a ransom. The applicant stated that he had been ill-treated during those arrests and also that in 2004 Russian soldiers had brutally beaten him in the course of an identity check. On 5 March 2007 the Federal Asylum Office (Bundesasylamt) dismissed the applicant’s asylum request as unfounded. It found the applicant’s story contradictory and unconvincing and also	[1]	2	1	1
228	 The application is brought by the estate of a Swedish national, Mr Alfred Nitschke, who was born in 1940 and died on 13 January 2003. From 1988 until its bankruptcy in 1997, Mr Nitschke owned 49 % of the company Restaurang Takåsen AB (hereinafter referred to as “the company”). He was a member of the board of directors and authorised to sign for the company as well as being responsible for the daily functioning of the company. The other shares (51%) were owned by Stockholms företagskrogar AB. On 3 November 1994 the Tax Authority (skattemyndigheten) of the County of Stockholm sent an audit report (granskningspromemoria) to Mr Nitschke, informing him that, following a tax audit of the company, it was considering altering the tax returns for the tax assessment years 1993 and 1994 for the company, as well as for Mr Nitschke, and imposing tax surcharges on them. On the basis of information from the audit, the Tax Authority concluded that Mr Nitschke had to be considered	[3]	3	1	1
229	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Kharkiv. On 2 September 1999 the police instituted criminal proceedings against him on suspicion of unlawful making and storage of a firearm. Throughout the major part of the proceedings the applicant was on a written undertaking not to abscond. On 4 October 1999 the case was transferred to the Zhovtnevyy District Court of Kharkiv (“District Court”), which on 21 February 2000 delivered a judgment. On 21 March 2000 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal (“Court of Appeal”) quashed it and remitted the case for additional investigations. Following the completion of additional investigations, on 4 September 2000 the case was referred to the District Court, which on 25 November 2005 found the applicant guilty as charged, sentenced him to three years of imprisonment and exempted him from the sentence as the charges against him became time-barred. On 25 February 2006 the Court of Appeal upheld the above judgment. 	[3]	2	1	0
230	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Budapest. On 17 January 2007 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant, then employed as a security guard, and his alleged accomplices. They were charged with aggravated extortion, endorsement of and profiteering from prostitution and other offences. The applicant, when he learned that the police had been looking for him, presented himself at the police station on his own initiative. On 18 January 2007 the prosecution filed a motion for his pre-trial detention. The risks of absconding, repetition of crime and collusion were referred to. On 19 January 2007 the Pest Central District Court ordered the detention. Only the last-mentioned reason was retained, since the court held that – in the face of the applicant’s settled family life, legal income and the fact that he had no previous convictions – the impending severe sanction was insufficient reason for assuming that he might abscond and, moreover	[2]	2	1	0
231	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Velenje. On 22 March 1994 and 11 February 1995 the applicant was injured while working for the Slovenian employer GVV in Russia. He consequently instituted two sets of civil proceedings in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages for the injuries sustained. In both proceedings an insurance company ZT was acting as an intervening party. First set of proceedings On 21 January 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against GVV seeking damages in the amount of 2,050,000 tolars (approximately 8,550 euros) for the injuries sustained on 22 March 1994. Between 23 July 1998 and 26 February 2001 the applicant lodged eight written submissions and/or adduced evidence. Between 24 November 1997 and 3 November 1999 he made three requests that a date be set for a hearing. Of the ten hearings held between 23 April 1998 and 27 February 2001, one was adjourned due to the absence of both parties and one wa	[3]	2	1	0
232	 The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Cahul. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1983 the applicant bought a house. The Cahul municipality subsequently allocated to the applicant the plot of land on which his house stood. In 1995, E., the applicant’s neighbour, moved the fence separating their respective plots and thus reduced the size of the applicant’s land. The applicant brought court proceedings against E., seeking the removal of all impediments on the part of E. to his use of his land. On 29 May 1995 the Cahul District Court found in favour of the applicant. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final. Following a request by the Prosecutor General’s Office, on 13 October 1995 the Supreme Court of Justice quashed the judgment of 29 May 1995 and ordered a full re-hearing. On 24 May 1996 the Cahul District Court rejected the applicant’s claims. In parallel, the applicant requested th	[3]	3	1	0
233	 The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Chişinău. He is a pensioner. In 1998 he lodged with the Râşcani District Court a civil action against a third person (“C.”) seeking compensation for alleged non-compliance with a contract between them. Between February and July 1998 the court adjourned the hearings on six occasions due to C.’s failure to appear before it. On 21 July 1998, the Râşcani District Court decided to hear the case in the absence of C., while finding that he had been legally summonsed. It upheld the applicant’s action and ordered C. to pay him 1,500 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of approximately 287 euros (EUR) at the time). Since neither of the parties appealed against the judgment within the legal time-limit of fifteen days, it became enforceable on 5 August 1998, when an enforcement warrant was issued. After that date the applicant complained on numerous occasions to different State authorities about the non-enf	[3, 9]	3	1	0
234	 The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Udachnyy, a town in the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic of the Russian Federation. The applicant brought a civil action against the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, seeking to recover the monetary value of state promissory notes for purchase of a Russian-made car. On 2 April 2003 the Mirninskiy District Court of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya) found for the applicant and awarded him 138,967 Russian roubles. By a decision of 14 May 2003 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya) rejected an appeal by the Ministry of Finance and upheld the judgment. On the same date the judgment of 2 April 2003 acquired legal force but it has never been enforced.

235	 The applicant was born in 1968. He is currently serving a life sentence. On 22 October 1999 the Donetsk Kuybyshevsky District Prosecutor’s Office instituted a criminal investigation into a series of murders accompanied by robberies. On an unspecified date the applicant and Mr L. were identified as possible perpetrators and were put on the list of wanted persons. The police also issued an internal search notice in which the applicant was described as a dangerous criminal. According to the applicant, in November 1999 his picture was shown on television as a previously convicted person who was wanted by the police in connection with multiple robberies. On 31 January 2000 the applicant and Mr L. were arrested. On 1 February 2000 the applicant was questioned as a suspect and refused to give a statement.

238	 The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Kryvyy Rig. Before his arrest he was rector of a State-owned university. On 23 September 2009 the applicant was medically examined. An endocrinologist noted that he had type-2 diabetes and prescribed insulin injections. The endocrinologist advised that commencement and adjustment of the insulin treatment should take place on an in-patient basis in a local hospital. On 29 September 2009 an investigator from the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office arrested the applicant on suspicion of having received bribes in his capacity as university rector. He was detained in the temporary detention facility of Kryvyy Rig (“the ITT”). On 2 October 2009 the Dzerzhynskyy District Court of Kryvyy Rig (“the District Court”) ordered the applicant’s detention for three months, stating, without referring to any concrete facts, that he might abscond, hinder the investigation or continue his criminal activities. The court also	[1, 2]	3	1	0
239	 The applicant was born in 1967 and lived in St Petersburg until his arrest. He is now serving his sentence in a correctional colony in Omsk. On 4 October 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud. Two days later he was charged with aggravated robbery. On the following day the St Petersburg City Prosecutor authorised his detention, finding that the applicant was liable to reoffend, pervert the course of justice and abscond, as he was charged with a particularly serious criminal offence, had been living unregistered in St Petersburg and in 1995 had been placed on the wanted persons' list owing to his absconding from an investigation into aggravated fraud. The prosecution authorities used the same grounds while further extending on 25 October and 17 December 1999 and 23 June 2000 the detention of the applicant and his eight co-defendants. On 12 May 2000 the applicant was charged with organisation of a criminal enterprise, twelve counts of robbery, unlawfu	[1, 2, 3]	2	1	0

On 28 February 2002 the Budapest Police Department heard the applicant, explaining that criminal proceedings were being conducted against him and three other defendants on suspicion of having participated in the sequestration and beating of a certain Mr K., and of having forced him to sign a false statement of debt, conduct punishable under sections 175 and 323 of the Criminal Code. Between 27 February 2002 and 21 March 2003, the defendants were interrogated on several occasions; moreover, several confrontations took place between the defendants themselves and between them and the victim. In particular, the applicant was interrogated on five occasions during this period. Also in the same perio	[2]	1	1	0

At a hearing held in December 2001 he objected to the decision of the judge hearing the case, who was the President of the Kazanluk District Court, to order a graphological examination of a photocopied document. The judge overruled his objection and the applicant appealed. On 7 December 2001, allegedly in order to illustrate the absurdness of the judge’s ruling, the applicant filed with the court photocopies of two declarations, asking that they be attached to his appeal. The first, purportedly emanating from the judge, said that she had forced the applicant to draw it up and that, to compensate him for the frustration and damage caused, she undertook to pay him 5,000 United States dollars (USD). The second, purportedly emanating from the director and an official of the forestry office, said that they owed the applican	[3]	2	1	0
242	 The applicant was born in 1980 and, at the time of lodging his application, he had been serving a custodial sentence at Pravieniškės prison. On 19 February 2003 the Kaišiadorys District Court convicted the applicant - together with an accomplice - of attempted drug dealing in large quantities (Articles 16 § 2 and 232-1 § 5 of the Criminal Code as then in force). The court established that the offence had been disclosed using a “Criminal Conduct Simulation Model” (“the model”), which had been authorised by the Prosecutor General on 29 May 2002. The court found that on 4 June 2002 V, a policeman acting as an undercover agent under the model, had met the applicant and, during their conversation on various topics, asked where he could get psychotropic drugs. The applicant had said that he could procure and sell samples to the policeman straight away, and more thereafter if the samples were good.

At 3 p.m. on 6 February 2003 the applicant was arrested in an apartment rented by his acquaintance and alleged accomplice D., and taken to a police station. At the police station he was allegedly handcuffed, beaten and according to the applicant, had his nose broken. On the same day between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. the applicant was questioned. He admitted to having robbed an apartment. Criminal proceedings for robbery were instituted against the applicant; it is unclear whether this was done before or after his arrest. It was noted that on 6 February 2003 at around 12.20 a.m. the applicant, together with some other individuals, had threatened K. with a knife and taken 12,800 United States dollars (USD) from her.

On 14 September 2001 an arrest warrant was issued against the applicant by an investigating judge of the Brussels Regional Court. A search of his home had led to the discovery of false passports, automatic weapons and ammunition, as well as chemical formulae that could be used for making explosives and a detailed plan of the United States Embassy in Paris. Following a simultaneous search of a Brussels café, where the applicant had been a regular customer, drawing on information provided by another suspect, who had also been arrested, the police discovered 59 litres of acetone and 96 kilograms of sulphur powder.

In 2003 a presidential election was held in Armenia with its first and second rounds taking place on 19 February and 5 March respectively. The applicant was involved with the work of the main opposition candidate and his responsibilities included monitoring the voting process. He alleges that, following the election, he prepared a report on various irregularities which had allegedly taken place during the election, but high officials from the Government and the Ararat Region tried to prevent him from making his report public, which he refused. The applicant further alleges that from February 2003 until his arrest on 20 May 2004 he was repeatedly harassed because of his political activity. In particular, the police frequently called him to the local police station	[3]	2	1	0
247	 The applicant had inherited half a mine producing fluoride, which on 28 January 1985 was assessed by an inspector. According to the Mining Code, minerals are owned by the State and may be assigned by the State to any person, in accordance with the provisions of the law. The main obligation of a mine owner is the exploitation of the mine (Articles 102 and s.). When the competent public service establishes that no exploitation or mining research is carried out in a mine in accordance with the provisions of the law, it forwards the pertinent particulars to the Mines Board which, after hearing the concerned parties, decides on the forfeiture of the right of ownership (Article 121). On 30 April 1986 the applicant asked the Ministry of Industry not to declare that he had forfeited his rights over the mine. He claimed that the mine’s production had dropped because its exploitation had provisionally become unprofitable. On 17 July 1986 the Ministry of Industry declared t	[3]	0	1	1

On 27 April 2005 the applicant was detained on suspicion of having committed that fraud and questioned as a suspect. He denied his involvement in the offence. On the same date the investigating authorities filed a request with the Golovinskiy District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”) to authorise the applicant’s detention on remand. On 28 April 2005 the District Court, composed of judge B., granted the investigator’s request and, with reference to Articles 100 and 108 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention, stating that he “had committed a se	[2, 3]	1	1	0

He was detained for a week and, when released, was issued with an order to leave the country. He did not apply for asylum in Greece. On 10 February 2009, after transiting through France, the applicant arrived in Belgium, where he presented himself to the Aliens Office with no identity documents and applied for asylum. The examination and comparison of the applicant’s fingerprints generated a Eurodac “hit” report on 10 February 2009 revealing that the applicant had been registered in Greece. The applicant was placed initially in the Lanaken open reception centre for asylum-seekers.

On 20 July 2010 criminal proceedings were instituted in respect of the applicant, as well as two other persons, on suspicion of municipal property embezzlement in particularly large amounts in the context of the tram reconstruction works. More specifically, the applicant was suspected of having artificially increased the price of the crushed stone purchased by his company. On 21 July 2010 the investigator of the Police Department for Combating Organised Crime telephoned the applicant and invited him to appear to give some explanations.

On 30 January 2001 the applicant applied to the Ministry of the Interior, requesting to be registered on the electoral roll in order to exercise his voting rights in the parliamentary election of 27 May 2001. On 8 February 2001 the Ministry of the Interior refused to enrol the applicant. The Ministry specified that, by virtue of Article 63 of the Constitution, members of the Turkish-Cypriot community could not be registered on the Greek-Cypriot electoral roll. Furthermore, the Ministry informed the applicant that the matter was under consideration by the Attorney-General of the Republic and that he would be informed of any developments. On 27 April 2001 the applicant lodged an application with the Supreme Court against the decision of the Ministry of the Interior.

On 12 September 2000 the applicant instituted before the Olsztyn Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) civil proceedings against Ms J.R. and Mr G.M. in which he claimed payment for construction work he had carried out. The applicant requested that his claim be considered in a summary procedure (postępowanie nakazowe). On 10 October 2000 the court allowed the action and issued a payment order against the defendant. The defendant appealed. Subsequently, all the judges of the Olsztyn Regional Court asked to be excluded from trying the case as the defendant was married to one of the judges.

254	 The applicant, a Turkish citizen of Kurdish origin, was born in 1963 and lives in the United Kingdom. He is the brother of Hüseyin Koku, who was allegedly detained by the police on 20 October 1994 and whose body was found in a location outside the town of Pötürge, in south east Turkey on 26 April 1995. The facts of the case, particularly concerning events which occurred between 20 October 1994 and 26 April 1995, are disputed by the parties. The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in Section B below (paragraphs 12-41). The Government’s submissions concerning the facts are summarised in Section C below (paragraphs 42-58). The documentary evidence submitted by the applicant and the Government is summarised in Sections D (paragraphs 59-87) and E (paragraphs 88-93) respectively. The applicant’s brother, Hüseyin Koku, was born in the town of Elbistan in south-east Turkey, in 1958. In 1978 he married Fatma Koku (née Güzel) and by 1994 they had had	[0]	2	1	0
255	 The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Benevento. On 5 May 1987 Mr F. asked the Benevento District Court to order the applicant to pay him 73,934,495 Italian lire (38,183.98 euros (EUR)) for professional services. On 11 May 1987 the President of the Benevento District Court granted the application. The order was served on the applicant on 20 May 1987. On 8 June 1987 the applicant challenged the order in the Benevento District Court. Preparation of the case for trial began on 24 September 1987. Of the twenty-nine hearings listed between 26 November 1987 and 16 October 1998 seven were adjourned by the court of its own motion, ten were devoted to organising expert evidence and supplementary findings and two were adjourned at the parties’ request. On 16 April 1999 the case was referred to the bench of judges dealing with the oldest cases (sezioni stralcio). Of the four hearings listed between 22 September 1999 and 8 February 2002 one was adjourned by	[3]	3	1	1
256	 The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Ercsi. On 19 August 1998 the applicant, a truck driver, was involved in a multiple road accident. Subsequently he was interrogated as a suspect for having negligently caused the death of six people and the serious injury of five others, three of whom became permanently disabled. After several hearings at which numerous witnesses testified and the opinions of several experts were obtained, on 9 April 2002 the Miskolc District Court acquitted the applicant. On 6 November 2002 the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court quashed this judgment as unfounded. In the resumed proceedings, the District Court held four hearings. On 6 May 2004 it found the applicant guilty as charged. It held that, apart from the responsibility of another driver who had died in the multiple collisions, the accident had essentially been caused by the applicant’s failure to maintain the brakes of his truck and his grossly negligen	[3]	2	1	0
257	 The applicant was born in 1985 and lived in Sarov, in the Nizhniy Novgorod region. An all-terrain vehicle and a car were stolen from private garages in Sarov in February and April 2008, respectively. An investigation unit at the Sarov police department (управление внутренних дел г. Саров, “the Sarov UVD”) instituted criminal proceedings into the thefts. The police had information about the applicant’s involvement in the thefts. At about 10.40 a.m. on 5 May 2008, V., an operative agent of the Sarov UVD, contacted the applicant by telephone and requested him to come to office no. 320 at the Sarov police station at 2 p.m. for questioning. At 2 p.m. on the same day the applicant arrived at the police station, as requested. He was accompanied by K., F., Zh. and P., who stayed outside awaiting his return. A police officer on duty registered the applicant’s arrival at the police station at 2 p.m. The applicant provided the following account of events at the poli	[1, 2]	1	1	0
258	 The applicant was arrested on 8 May 1996 on suspicion of having committed an aggravated robbery while acting as a member of an organised criminal gang. On 9 May 1996 the District Prosecutor issued a detention order against him on charges of aggravated robbery involving use of a firearm and committed in conspiracy with other persons. The prosecutor referred to a reasonable suspicion, based on witnesses’ testimony, and the risk that the applicant might go into hiding or exert pressure on witnesses. Detention was imposed until 8 August 1996. The applicant was detained on the same date as two other accused persons. Yet another suspect was detained on 23 August 1996. The investigation and subsequent court proceedings were conducted against five persons jointly, four of them detained and one at liberty. On 10 May 1996 the applicant’s defence counsel appealed against the detention order. He challenged the credibility of the evidence in the applicant’s case, stating that 	[3]	0	1	0
259	 The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Gdynia, Poland. On 8 May 1999 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 9 May 1999 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed robbery, kidnapping and larceny. The applicant’s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) on 24 May 1999. On 25 January 2000 the applicant was indicted before the Gdańsk Regional Court. The applicant’s detention was prolonged on 27 January 2000. The court reiterated the grounds originally given for his detention and stressed the gravity of the charges. On 10 April 2000 the first hearing took place before the trial court. On 18 May 2000 the Gdańsk Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s application for release. The court considered that the evidence obtained in the case sufficiently justified the charges laid against	[2, 3]	1	1	0
260	 The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Leipzig. At the age of three, the applicant was placed in a children’s home and later in the care of foster parents. At the age of seven, he was adopted by his foster parents and was given their family name. After that, he did not have any contact with his family of origin. In 1984, the applicant’s biological sister, S. K., was born. The applicant was unaware of his sister’s existence until he re-established contact with his family of origin in 2000. Following their mother’s death in December 2000, the relationship between the siblings intensified. As from January 2001, the applicant and his sister had consensual sexual intercourse. They lived together for several years. In 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2005 four children were born to the couple. Following the birth of the fourth child, the applicant underwent a vasectomy. The three older children were placed in the care of foster families. The youngest daughter lives wi	[]	2	1	1
261	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Mozirje. On 2 December 2002 the applicant instituted proceedings before the Ljubljana Labour and Social Court challenging a decision rejecting his claim for disability insurance. On 9 June 2005 the first hearing was held and the court delivered a judgment, rejecting the applicant’s request in whole. He appealed. On 23 March 2006 the Higher Labour and Social Court upheld the appeal and remitted the case for re-examination. Between 15 June 2006 and 19 October 2006 three hearings were held and the court appointed one expert. On 19 October 2006 the first-instance court delivered a judgment. The defendant appealed. On 1 March 2007 the Higher Labour and Social Court upheld the appeal in part and modified the first-instance judgment. This decision was served on the applicant on 3 April 2007.	[3]	2	1	0
262	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Balıkesir. The applicant is a doctor. On 23 November 1998, another doctor, V.B., brought a case against the applicant before the Ayvalık Civil Court, requesting compensation for defamation. V.B. alleged that the applicant had diffused false information among his patients to the effect that he had been selling a certain unauthorised medicine. V.B. relied on a note obtained from a certain patient A.S., in which the name of the medicine, as well as his name and work address were written. According to the plaintiff, this note was written by the applicant in order to damage his reputation. In the course of the proceedings, the court heard statements from several witnesses such as doctors and nurses working at the health centre, who confirmed V.B.’s account of the facts. In particular, some of the witnesses submitted that they had seen A.S. with this note. At the hearing on 8 June 2000 the applicant admitted 	[3]	2	1	0
263	 The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Riga. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 4 November 2000 the applicant addressed a letter to the World Bank, the Parliament of the Republic of Latvia and the President of the Supreme Court in which he alleged, somewhat confusedly, that certain judges in Latvia were corrupt and had acted fraudulently. In the letter he called the President of the Civil Cases Division of the Senate of the Supreme Court “a super cheater” and “a fundamental cheater who commits criminal offences”. He insisted that the judges should be prosecuted for various crimes. It appears that on other occasions before and after the aforementioned letter, the applicant had accused various other state officials in a similar manner. On 20 December 2000, upon an application received from the President of the Supreme Court, the prosecutor’s office instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant f	[2]	3	1	0
264	 The applicant, Mr Oskar Orzeł, is a Polish national who was born in 1978. He is a student and lives in Częstochowa, Poland. Since early childhood, the applicant suffered from chronic inflammation of the vascular coat of his eyes. On 27 December 1984 the Katowice Clinical Hospital (Szpital Kliniczny w Katowicach) began to provide the applicant with both outpatient and inpatient care. After a few months, Professor G.-Ł. was put in charge of the applicant’s treatment. In October 1988 Professor G.-Ł. recommended that the applicant undergo a laser coagulation surgery of his right eye. As she did not have experience in providing that kind of treatment, she decided that Doctor F.‑K. would perform the surgery. In the early morning of 4 November 1988 the applicant, who at that time was ten years old, arrived together with his mother at the Katowice Clinical Hospital. At 11 a.m. Doctor F.-K. started to receive patients. The applicant was received at around 2 p.m. a	[3]	1	1	0
265	 The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Bielsko-Biała, Poland. On 15 March 2000 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed homicide. On 16 March 2000 the Żywiec District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that he be detained on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, the serious nature of that offence, the severity of the anticipated penalty and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation, in particular the process of obtaining evidence. During the investigation the applicant’s detention was extended on several occasions. He filed numerous but unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against the decisions prolonging his detention. The applicant made repeated applications for release on personal grounds, submitting that he had to secure the care and well‑being of his 3 year old son. He also contested the reasonableness of the charge agai	[2]	1	1	0
266	 The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in the town of Pokachi, Tyumen Region. On 1 July 1999 the applicant was arrested and charged with sexual assault of a minor. Immediately upon his arrest, at 3.15 a.m., the applicant was subjected to a body search at the police station. The report stated, inter alia, that no injuries were found on the applicant. On the same day at 5 a.m. the applicant underwent a physical examination in the presence of attesting witnesses A.T. and P. No injuries were noted in the examination report. The applicant alleges that during the examination the officer of the detention facility of the Interior of Pokachi (ИВС Покаческого ГОВД), T., beat him up with a police truncheon and that investigator B. abused him verbally. On the same day at 9 a.m. the applicant was assigned legal counsel.

267	 The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Baia Mare. On 1 April 2002 the Maramureş County Court ordered a company I.W., the applicant’s former employer, to reinstate him in his post and to pay him compensation. This decision became final. However, on 30 September 2002 the same court granted I.W.’s request and annulled the 1 April 2002 decision (contestaţie în anulare). It proceeded to re-examine the case and dismiss the applicant’s initial action. The 30 September 2002 decision was drafted on 28 October 2002 and typed up on 30 October 2002. In accordance with the rules of procedure, it was not served on the parties. On 18 December 2002 the applicant requested the Procurator-General to lodge an application with the Supreme Court of Justice for an audit setting aside the decision of 30 September 2002 (recurs în anulare). On 20 March 2003, the Procurator-General refused to act upon the applicant’s request. In a decision of 3 February 2000, which was upheld	[3]	3	1	0
268	 The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Rogaška Slatina. On 18 July 1996 the applicant was injured in a car accident. The perpetrator of the accident had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT. On 7 September 1998 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 7,715,240 tolars (approximately 32,200 euros) for the injuries sustained. Between 10 May 1999 and 26 April 2002 the applicant made three requests that a date be set for a hearing. Between 26 April 2002 and 16 January 2003 he lodged three preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence. Of the four hearings held between 11 September 2002 and 21 March 2003 none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. The hearing scheduled for 23 March 2001 was cancelled further to the request of both parties, lodged on 8 March 2001, in order to attempt to settle the case out of court.

269	 The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. The applicant was born in Iraq in 1957. He played for the Iraqi basketball team until, following his refusal to join the Ba’ath Party, he left Iraq in 1978 and lived in the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1992, where he made a claim for asylum and was granted indefinite leave to remain. He was granted British nationality in June 2000. In September 2004 the applicant and his four eldest children travelled from London to Iraq, via Dubai. He was arrested and questioned in Dubai by United Arab Emirates intelligence officers, who released him after twelve hours, permitting him and his children to continue their journey to Iraq, where they arrived on 28 September 2004. On 10 October 2004 United States soldiers, apparently acting on information provided by the British intelligence services, arrested the applicant at his sister’s house in Baghdad. He was taken to Basra in a British m	[2]	0	1	1
270	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Istanbul. He is the father of Hakan Kasa, who was killed by a number of police officers on 13 August 1993. The facts of the case as presented by the applicant and the Government are based on a number of documents drawn up in the course of the domestic investigation. The following information is taken from the parties’ submissions as well as from the documents submitted by them. On 12 July 1993 police officer Mehmet Bulut was shot in the shoulder in a marketplace in Istanbul. The injury was not fatal. The perpetrators managed to escape and the police officer’s pistol went missing during the incident. The police began a search to find the perpetrators and to recover the pistol. At around midday on 13 August 1993 the police received an anonymous telephone call from a man who stated that there were a number of armed persons in a café on the 11th floor of a shopping mall in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul who were b	[0]	2	1	0

The applicant has an I.Q. of 62, which is within the bottom 1% of the general population. He has an understanding of spoken English equivalent to that of a six year-old child. On the morning of 13 October 2004, the body of Mr Williamson was found on the banks of the Blackwater River in County Tyrone. The applicant had spent most of the previous day drinking in public with the deceased and a third man, Mr Samuel Houston. There was evidence from witnesses that both Mr Houston and the applicant had been threatening and aggressive towards a number of individuals including the deceased. One witness also stated that, when Mr Houston produced a knife and said he was going to kill the deceased, the applicant encouraged him to “just kill him”. There was also evidence that the applicant and Mr Houston asked the deceased to come out to fight wi	[]	1	1	1
272	 The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Istanbul. At the time of the events giving rise to this application, the applicant was the manager of the post office in Beyoğlu, Istanbul. He wrote an article entitled “An open letter to Ms G.B., former Director of the Istanbul PTT”, in which he criticised Ms G.B.’s negligence in the project to restore the Beyoğlu post office building and blamed her for the dilapidated state and partial collapse of the building. In May 2000, the article was published in the 496th issue of the Pos‑Tel magazine, a non‑profit-making publication of the State postal service (“the PTT”), which has approximately 28,000 employees. In the same edition of the magazine, in an article entitled “PTT Hospital and Beyoğlu Post office”, the editor-in-chief also criticised the restoration project and claimed that the amount paid for the project suggested that it had been carried out to make certain people richer. He concluded that those who were respons	[6]	3	1	0
273	 The applicant was born in 1959 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Jelgava Prison. On 4 October 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder. On 13 September 2002 the Riga Regional Court (Rīgas apgabaltiesa) convicted the applicant of aggravated murder, burglary and theft and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. On 3 February 2003 the Criminal Cases Chamber of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Krimināllietu tiesu palāta) upheld the conviction for burglary and theft, acquitted the applicant of the charge of aggravated murder, and convicted him of murder instead. The sentence was reduced to twelve years’ imprisonment. On 17 March 2003 the Senate of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Senāts) dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant in a preparatory meeting. The applicant has since been serving his sentence in various prisons: Central Prison, Brasa Prison, Matīsa Prison, Jelgava Prison, Daugavpils	[1]	2	1	0
274	 The applicant was born in 1968 and lived in Balezino in the Republic of Udmurtiya prior to his arrest. On 29 December 2005 the applicant was arrested on drug-related charges and taken to the local anti-narcotics unit. According to the applicant, he was beaten by policemen and then questioned in the absence of a lawyer. On 8 November 2006 the Balezinskiy District Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to two years and ten months’ imprisonment. It appears that the applicant did not appeal against the judgment. During several periods between 29 December 2005 and 9 November 2006 the applicant was held in IVS Balezino, a temporary detention facility located in the Udmurtiya Republic. The applicant submitted that the facility had been overcrowded. There were no windows in the cells where he stayed. The ventilation and water taps did not function. No mattresses or bed linen was available. Moreover, the detainees 	[1]	2	1	0
275	 The applicant was born in 1948 and is currently detained in Voghera. On 6 August 1996 the applicant, accused of international drug‑trafficking, was arrested in Milan. He was in possession of a false passport in the name of José Luis Troccoli Perdomo. On 7 August 1996 the applicant was questioned by the Milan Public Prosecutor. Criminal proceedings were instituted against José Luis Troccoli Perdomo. By an order of 9 August 1996, the Milan investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody. He observed that there was strong evidence of guilt against the applicant, who was in possession of documents showing that he was in contact with persons connected to drug-trafficking. Given the amount of cocaine (104 kilograms) imported by those persons and the fact that they were probably part of a major criminal organisation, the investigating judge considered that there was a serious risk of re-offending and a risk of tampering with evidence. Moreover, the appl	[2]	2	1	1
276	 The applicant was born in 1920 and lives in Edineţ. In 1949 the applicant was persecuted by the communist authorities. His property was confiscated and he was exiled to Siberia for fifteen years. In 1989 he was rehabilitated. On an unspecified date in 2003 he brought an action against the Edineţ Department of Finances, seeking compensation for the confiscation of his property. On 25 September 2003 the Edineţ District Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to pay him 80,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 5,198 euros (EUR) at the time). The judgment was not appealed against and after fifteen days it became final and enforceable. On 27 October 2003 a Bailiff received the enforcement warrant. On 28 January 2005 the Bailiff sent the enforcement warrant to the President of Edineţ County, without having enforced it. The judgment of 25 September 2003 has not been enforced to date.

277	 The applicant, Mr Nikolay Mikhaylovich Rantsev, is a Russian national who was born in 1938 and lives in Svetlogorsk, Russia. He is the father of Ms Oxana Rantseva, also a Russian national, born in 1980. The facts of the case, as established by the submissions of the parties and the material submitted by them, in particular the witness statements taken by the Cypriot police, may be summarised as follows. Oxana Rantseva arrived in Cyprus on 5 March 2001. On 13 February 2001, X.A., the owner of a cabaret in Limassol, had applied for an “artiste” visa and work permit for Ms Rantseva to allow her to work as an artiste in his cabaret (see further paragraph 115 below). The application was accompanied by a copy of Ms Rantseva’s passport, a medical certificate, a copy of an employment contract (apparently not yet signed by Ms Rantseva) and a bond, signed by [X.A.] Agencies, in the following terms (original in English): “KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS that I [X.A.] of L/	[0, 2]	3	1	0
278	 The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Kharkiv. At about 11 a.m. on 18 July 2005 several police officers in civilian clothes came to the hostel where the applicant lived, and invited him to come with them to their office. The applicant followed the officers, who took him to the Kominternivskyy District police station (hereafter “the police station”). On arrival the applicant was notified that the police had received complaints from two mothers implicating him in sexual abuse of their minor daughters, and was questioned on this matter. At about 5 p.m. on the same day the applicant confessed to the offence and signed permission for the police to inspect his home. At about 6 p.m. seven or eight police officers, including those who had questioned the applicant, took him back to the hostel, examined his room, seized a bed cover, a rug and some of the applicant’s personal belongings, and brought the applicant back to the police station.

279	 The applicant was born in 1953. At the time of the introduction of his application, the applicant was serving a prison sentence in the Netherlands. On or around 26 January 1995 suspicions arose that the applicant, who at that time was serving a prison sentence in the Marwei penitentiary in Leeuwarden, had been involved in giving a false tip-off by telephone to the Leeuwarden police to the effect that three named detainees were planning to escape from prison by taking hostages. Thereafter, and in order to secure order, peace and safety in the penitentiary, the applicant’s telephone conversations were tapped and recorded on tape. These taped conversations were kept so as to allow the authorities to establish – if such a situation were to arise again – whether the applicant had been involved in giving any further false telephone tip-offs. On 3 October 1995, as a result of the detonation of an explosive device placed in her car, Ms X – the applicant’s former partner –	[4]	2	1	1
280	 The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Częstochowa, Poland. In June 1995, on his way to work, the applicant bought a bottle of sparkling mineral water. While he was opening it, the bottle exploded and its metal cap hit the applicant’s left eye. The accident, despite the subsequent surgeries and medical treatment, resulted in the applicant’s loss of vision in his left eye. He was declared an invalid and was granted a disability pension by the Social Security Board (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych). In August 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings for compensation and pension against the producer of the mineral water. He submitted medical certificates issued by the Częstochowa and Katowice Hospitals which treated his injury. On 23 October 1997 the Częstochowa Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki w Częstochowie) exempted the applicant from the court fees. On 15 November and 15 December 1997 the trial court held hearings.

281	 The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Krasnodar. On 15 April 1994 the applicant made a deposit in a savings account with the commercial bank Yurak (“the bank”). After the bank announced that it was changing the interest rate, the applicant requested the closure of his account in August 1994, but the bank informed him that it was unable to repay his capital plus interest as its funds were insufficient. The applicant sued the bank, seeking repayment of the capital he had deposited, together with interest, a penalty payment and compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. On 20 February 1995 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of the town of Krasnodar partly upheld the applicant’s claims and ordered the bank to pay him a total of 10,156 Russian roubles (RUB) (which included the capital of the deposit, interest accrued, compensation for non-pecuniary damage and penalties). That decision was upheld and became final on 21 March 1995. In a judgment of the Okt	[]	2	1	0

A member and leader of the “green” political party Les Verts, and former regional councillor and member of the European Parliament, since 1987 he has been mayor of Bègles and Vice-President of the Urban Community of Bordeaux and, since 1997, member of parliament for La Gironde. He has also worked as a journalist – from 1977 to 1992, for example – for the State television channel Antenne 2. In October 1999 the applicant took part in the recording of an infotainment programme for television called Tout le monde en parle (“Everyone’s talking about it”), presented by Thierry Ardisson, which was aired on the State television channel France 2 during the night of 23 to 24 October 1999. During the programme Michel Polac, another guest personality, mentioned the Chernobyl nuclear accident of 26 April 1986 and spoke of the emotion he had felt on reading a book dedicated to the victims of the disaster.

The latter was eventually obliged to re-employ the applicant. The applicant did not accept the position that was offered to him in pursuit of the re-employment order. New litigation started on 5 January 2006. On 18 November 2008 the Budapest Labour Court dismissed the applicant’s action. On appeal, on 9 July 2010 the Budapest Regional Court reversed this decision and found for the applicant. The respondent pursued a petition for review before the Kúria. On 29 February 2012 this court reversed the appeal judgment and found for the respondent.	[3]	2	1	0
284	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Bad Mitterndorf, Austria. On 16 September 1989 the applicant was the victim of an assault and was heavily injured. He was brought to the Bad Aussee Hospital (Landeskrankenhaus) where he received medical treatment as he suffered from pulmonary disease. The applicant underwent an operation and was transferred to the Graz Hospital where another operation was carried out. After this medical treatment the applicant's ability to work was considerably reduced. He became unemployed and was without income. On 27 November 1992 he instituted civil proceedings against the Steiermärkische Krankenanstalten Gesellschaft mbH, the company which administers public hospitals in the region of Styria. He claimed damages for pain and suffering and loss of profit. He alleged that medical malpractice had caused his state of health and that the surgeons treating him had infringed their duty to provide explanations and advice concerning the trea	[3]	2	1	1
285	 The applicant was born in 1967 and is currently serving a prison sentence in correctional facility no. IK-19 in Tavda, in the Sverdlovsk region. On 11 June 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of abduction involving an organised criminal group and he was placed in detention. Three days later, the relevant prosecutor ordered his detention pending trial. On 18 June 1999 the applicant was officially charged. On 6 January 2000 he was further charged with abduction, extortion, and illegal acquisition and possession of firearms and drugs.

286	 The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Fîrlădeni. Her late husband, Mr Alexandru Ciobanu (“the victim”), was a taxi driver and died at work, in a car accident on 6 April 2008. He was twenty-seven years’ old at the time and the father of a three-year-old child. The present application is about the circumstances of his death and the investigation carried out by the Moldovan authorities into those circumstances. The accident happened at approximately 11.30 p.m. on 6 April 2008 in an illuminated two-way street with two lanes in the town of Hîncești. The speed limit was 40 k.p.h. and a solid line in the centre of the road indicated that no overtaking was allowed. A petrol station was located on one side of the road and there was a short broken line allowing cars to enter the petrol station from the opposite side of the road. There are two versions of the events leading to the accident. The first version is based on the accounts of two eyewitnesses. Accord	[0]	1	1	0
287	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Grozny. According to the applicant, he experiences difficulties in reconstructing the events during and following his detention coherently and chronologically. On account of his ill-treatment in custody, the applicant suffers from memory lapses.

The applicant owned real estate consisting of a house and outhouses at 94 Flotskaya Street, the Oktyabrskiy District of Grozny. At the material time he lived there alone, since his relatives had left the Chechen Republic after the renewal of hostilities in October 1999. The applicant remained in Grozny to look after the house and other possessions. The latter comprised personal belongings of the applicant and his relatives, furniture, an audio system, a satellite dish, two Subaru vehicles and an Oldsmobile car.

It appears that she had left Sri Lanka in 1992 and stayed in India before, at some unknown time, she was granted asylum in Denmark, apparently due to her connections with the LTTE. Three children were born to the couple in 2000, 2002 and 2005. By a judgment of 4 July 2006 by the City Court in Tønder (Retten i Tønder), upheld on appeal on 19 September 2006 by the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret), the applicant was convicted of the sexual abuse of a girl who was less than twelve years old.

After mass disorder and inter-ethnic clashes in the region in June 2010, he fled to Russia, together with many other ethnic Uzbeks, for fear of ethnic‑motivated violence. It appears that his next of kin remain in Kyrgyzstan. In August 2010 the applicant arrived in Russia and received a temporary residence permit for the period from 3 December 2010 to 3 December 2013. After the applicant’s departure from Kyrgyzstan, on 25 June 2010 the Kyrgyz authorities charged him in absentia with involvement in riots accompanied by violence, inter-ethnic clashes, arson, use of firearms and destruction of property on 17 June 2010 in the city of Osh, Kyrgyz Republic.

302	 The applicant, born in 1936, lives in Vienna (Austria). At the relevant time the applicant was the owner of several firms, whose business was trading in fowl and game as well as the processing, importation and exportation of meat. From 1975 onwards, one of the firms imported meat, processed it and re-exported it without putting it on the domestic market. Such an activity is exempted from restrictions to which the ordinary importation of meat is subject and the applicant was accordingly issued a permit for inward processing (aktiver Veredelungsverkehr) setting out the conditions for import and export. On 25 June 1981 the Investigating Judge at the Vienna Regional Court (Landesgericht) instituted preliminary investigations against the applicant who was suspected of having breached the conditions of the inward processing permit by having exported a different quality of meat than he had imported and by having put the imported meat onto the domestic market without ha	[3]	3	1	1

The report began by discussing the history of Switzerland during the Second World War, as supposedly experienced by the people at the time and taught for many years in schools. Switzerland had been portrayed as a brave country which, despite its neutrality, had been on the side of democracy and thus of the Allies. After this recounting of the “myth”, the journalist stated: “There has been a somewhat rude awakening.” The programme continued wit	[6]	2	1	1

On 5 February 1996 the sale in question was annulled by a court order on the ground that the instalments had not been paid in time. The decision annulling the sale became final on 3 October 1997 and on 14 November 1997 Mr Gövderelioğlu was requested by the Istanbul Bankruptcy Office to return the purchased goods within seven days. He did not comply with that request. On 10 August 2000 Mr Gövderelioğlu died. Due to his non-compliance with the Bankruptcy Office’s order to return the goods, on 5 June 2001 the bankrupt estate of the aforementioned company filed an action against Mr Gövderelioğlu’s heirs, including the applicant, before the Şişli Court of Fir	[3]	3	1	0
317	 The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant works in a municipal school in Orel; his wife is a librarian. They own a two-room apartment measuring 27.9 square metres, which they share with their two children, a daughter and a son. Their daughter is handicapped – she suffers from severe diabetes. In 1988 the applicant’s family was put on the “general” waiting list for residents of Orel who have sub-standard housing and who are therefore entitled to more spacious social housing (otherwise called “the list for those in need of better housing”). From 1997 onwards the applicant filed numerous requests with the local authorities of Orel seeking better housing for his family, which, in his view, they were entitled to on the ground of his daughter’s illness. In 1999 the applicant’s family was put on the local authorities’ “first priority” list of persons needing improved living conditions, on account of his daughter’s ill	[]	0	1	0
318	 The applicant was born in 1919 and lives in Celje. On 11 June 1998 the applicant’s request for the approval of his medical treatment in a foreign country was rejected by the Slovenia Health Insurance Institute (“ZZZS”). On 21 July 1998 the applicant instituted proceedings against ZZZS in the Ljubljana Labour and Social Court (Delovno in socialno sodiščev v Ljubljani) seeking reimbursement of the cost for the before mentioned medical treatment. Between 22 June 2000 and 11 September 2001 the applicant lodged seven preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence. Between 1 March 1999 and 6 November 2001 he made six requests that a date be set for a hearing. On 7 June 2000 the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal with the Ministry of Justice (Ministrstvo za pravosodje) because of delays in the proceedings. Of the three hearings held between 12 July 2000 and 19 December 2001, none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. During the proceedings, the court	[3]	3	1	0
319	 The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Biskupiec. On 19 June 2002 the applicant was arrested on charges of arson and uttering threats. On an unknown later date he was indicted before the Biskupiec District Court. Between 19 March and 19 June 2006 the applicant was detained on remand. On 3 June 2003 the District Court convicted him as charged and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. On 26 June 2003 the applicant appealed against his conviction. On 16 October 2003 the Olsztyn Regional Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case. Between 19 October 2005 and 29 March 2006 the District Court held seven hearings. On several occasions the applicant who was duly summoned, refused to appear at hearings. However, the court proceeded with the trial in his absence. On 31 March 2006 the Biskupiec District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. On 14 Septe	[3]	2	1	0
320	 On the morning of 18 January 2000, the body of Curtis Seymour, a taxi‑driver, was found in a refuse disposal area in Grand Cayman. He had been stabbed to death. His van, which he used as a taxi, was found nearby with blood on the interior upholstery. An examination of the van revealed a palm print on the passenger door frame which matched that of Mr Brian Powell, who at that time was living with the applicant. Mr Powell’s fingerprint was also found at the gate of the refuse disposal area together with another set of blood-stained fingerprints. On 5 February 2000, Mr Powell was arrested. When interviewed, he denied any personal knowledge of the murder. On 9 February 2000, he made a statement under caution. He claimed that the applicant had developed a plan to rob a taxi driver and that Mr Powell had accompanied him for this purpose. They had travelled in a taxi driven by Mr Seymour. When the taxi stopped, the applicant had held Mr Seymour from behind and demanded money. Mr 	[]	0	1	1
321	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Križ. On 8 March 2000 the Ivanić Grad Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Ivanić Gradu) gave judgment ordering a certain S.R. to pay the applicant 9,600 German marks (DEM). The judgment became final and enforceable on 17 June 2000. On 28 November 2001 the applicant sought enforcement of the above judgment. On 7 December 2001 the Sisak Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Sisku) issued an enforcement order. It decided to seize S.R.'s movable property and sell it at a public auction. On 5 March 2002 the applicant informed the court that he advanced the costs of the proceedings. The court bailiff attempted to conduct the first on-site inspection on 22 April 2002, but S.R. was not found on the address provided by the applicant. His parents, I. and J.R., informed the bailiff that S.R. had not lived at that address for the past three years. The court scheduled another on-site inspection for 3 September 2002. However, 	[3]	1	1	0
322	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Gliwice. On 20 April 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of producing drugs and other related offences. On his arrest the applicant informed the authorities about his health condition. On the same day the applicant underwent a medical examination. On the following day he was placed under hospital observation. On 22 April 2006 the Gliwice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) remanded him in custody. The court decided that in view of the applicant’s health he should be committed to the medical wing of the detention centre. The court stressed that the evidence gathered so far demonstrated a high likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. The court further referred to the fact that the applicant had not pleaded guilty to the offences in question and therefore if released he could obstruct the proceedings. The preventive measure in question was also justified by the gravity of t	[2]	2	1	0
323	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in the Ivanovo Region. According to the applicant, in 1991, at the age of fifteen, he moved to Russia from Georgia with his parents. In 1998 he settled in Shuya, Ivanovo Region, whereas his parents moved back to Georgia. On 18 November 1999 the Shuya Town Court of the Ivanovo Region found the applicant guilty of extortion and theft of a passport, and sentenced him to three years and one month’s imprisonment. According to the applicant, in order to spare his mother’s feelings, he told the prosecuting authorities that his name was Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili. On 4 June 2001 the applicant was released on parole. Upon release he was issued with an ID card in the name of Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili. On 26 April 2005 the Town Court found the applicant guilty of theft and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. Again he claimed that his name was Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili and presented the 	[1]	2	1	0
324	 The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Gdańsk. On 2 March 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and theft committed as part of an organised criminal gang. On 3 March 2003 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) ordered his pre-trial detention. It referred to the likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. It further considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would obstruct the investigation by inducing witnesses to give false testimony. In the course of the investigation the applicant’s detention was prolonged by the Regional Court several times. The court referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and the complexity of the case. It relied on the fact that there were no circumstances to justify the application of a different preventive measure. On 20 November 2003 the Gdańsk Regional Prosecutor (Prokura	[2]	1	1	0

In October 2000 the Butzbach prison authorities ordered him to move from his single cell to a cell which he would have to share with two other inmates and which did not have a screen or curtain separating the toilet from the rest of the cell. By letter of 11 October 2000 the applicant, referring to a decision given by the Frankfurt Court of Appeal in 1985 in a case concerning a different prisoner, informed the head of Butzbach prison that accommodation in such a cell was generally unlawful and that he refused to move. On that same date, the applicant lodged a motion with the Gießen Regional Court, which was brought to the attention of that court only after the applicant’s transfer to the multi-occupancy cell. On 12 October 2000 the prison staff ordered the applicant to vacate his single cell and announced that they would use force (u	[1]	2	1	1

During the 1975‑88 period the applicant was convicted six times of various offences: theft, car theft, deserting military duties and possession of narcotic drugs. In 1988 the applicant fled Bulgaria to Austria, travelling through the former Yugoslavia and Italy on a Yugoslav passport. The applicant submits that he left Bulgaria on 25 June 1988, but according to the Pernik District Court's judgment of 30 October 1989 (see paragraph 15 below) he committed a rape on 13 July 1988 and an attempted rape on 3 September 1988, both offences taking place in Bulgaria. In 1990 the applicant settled in the United States of America, where he lived until 1999. On 13 September 1988 criminal proceedings were opened against the applicant on charges of rape. There is no indication – and it has not been argued by the Government – that the applicant was notified of the proceedings. O	[2]	2	1	0

The applicant suffers from behavioural disorders and was alternately kept in prison and hospital psychiatric wards between 1996 and 2004. He suffers from chronic schizophrenic psychosis, with hallucinations, delusions and aggressive and addictive behaviour. On 21 May 2005 the applicant was sent to Toulon-La Farlède prison after causing damage in Chalucet psychiatric hospital, where he had asked to be admitted. As a result, on 30 June 2005 he was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment, of which ten months were suspended. On his arrival at the prison he allegedly set fire to his mattress. He was placed under psychiatric observation, then made to share a cell with another detainee, who was known to have psychiatric problems. On 16 August 2005 a fire broke out in the applicant's cell. Both detainees suffered serious injuries. With burns on 65% of his 	[1]	2	1	1

On 29 January 1995 the Ivolginskiy District police department instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and several other individuals. They were accused of severely injuring Mr I. during a public disturbance. An investigator questioned the applicant in the presence of legal-aid counsel, Mrs N. On the same day the applicant was remanded in custody. In September 1995 the applicant was served with a bill of indictment and the case was committed for trial to the Ivolginskiy District Court.  On 1 December 1995 the District Court found the applicant guilty of disorderly conduct and causing serious injury. It sentenced him to four years' probation. The applicant was released on the same day. The judgment of 1 December 1995 was upheld on appeal and became final on 14 March 1996.

On 14 March 1997 the applicant was issued with a new driving licence. He had applied for it only shortly before, i.e. in 1997. During the intervening period, between 3 November 1995 and 14 March 1997, the Government Road Transport Agency (Rijksdienst voor het Wegverkeer – “the Agency”) registered a total of 1,737 motor vehicles in the applicant’s name in the vehicle registration system (kentekenregister), but without his consent. It would appear that these registrations were effected upon presentation of the applicant’s stolen driving licence. As a consequence of these vehicles being registered in his name, the applicant received large numbers of motor vehicle tax assessments (aanslagen motorrijtuigenbelasting/houderschapsbelasting), he was on many occasions prosecuted on the ba	[4]	2	1	1

In 1994 the applicant founded an individual enterprise “Pyramid” (Частное Индивидуальное Предприятие «Пирамида»). On 15 March 1999 he signed an agreement with a State-owned maintenance company “Department of housing and communal services of Yakutsk” according to which the applicant's company undertook to perform certain construction works for the company. Upon the completion of the works, the maintenance company refused to pay. Following a financial dispute, the parties signed a friendly settlement, according to which the maintenance company owed the applicant's company 43,517 RUR (~ EUR 1,609). This settlement was confirmed by a judgment of the Commercial Court of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya) delivered on 11 June 2002, and became enforceable. On 25 March 2003 the bailiffs informed the applicant about the impossibility to enforce the settlement bec	[3, 9]	2	1	0

On 3 August 2000 he was arrested on a charge of taking a bribe of 4,000 United States dollars (USD) in exchange for a favour concerning a case he was dealing with. The arrest in flagrante delicto was filmed by two cameras from different angles. Both videos were included in the domestic criminal file and were sent to the Court by the Government. One of the videos shows a group of police officers wearing plain clothes enter a room, which looks like a small bar, where the applicant is drinking beer with the briber. At the sight of the police officers, the applicant dips his fingers into a mug of beer, after which he is immediately grabbed and restrained by four police officers. Since the applicant attempts to bend down, three police officers hold his hands behind his back while another one holds his head up. Subsequent	[1]	2	1	0
332	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Florence. He is the owner of a flat in Florence, which he had let to A.R. In a registered letter of 29 June 1987, the applicant informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1987 and asked him to vacate the premises by that date. The tenant told the applicant that he would not leave the premises. In a writ served on the tenant on 7 July 1989, the applicant reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Florence Magistrate. By a decision of 21 September 1989, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Florence Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 21 September 1990. On 25 November 1994, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises. On 9 February 1995, he served notice on the tenant in	[3, 9]	2	1	1

On 4 November 2003 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 5 November 2003 the applicant was released. The Kraków Appeal Prosecutor (Prokuratura Apelacyjna) suspended the applicant from professional duties and ordered that he be subjected to police supervision in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. It further referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation. On 20 November 2003 the applicant lodged an application with the prosecutor, requesting access to the investigation file. On 28 November 2003 the prosecutor dismissed the application.

According to the Government, in the evening of 11 October 2001 the Oktyabrskiy District police station received an emergency call from a local shop. Police officers were sent to the shop to investigate. On their arrival a shop security guard, Mr G., informed the police officers that a drunken man, who was subsequently identified as the applicant, was using offensive language and shouting in the shop, not responding to reprimands and disturbing the work of the shop. The Government provided written statements made by Mr G. and Ms V., a shop assistant, on 14 May 2005.

At the time of the events, he was the father of a pupil of a secondary school in Grieskirchen (Bundesoberstufenrealgymnasium) and vice-chairman and recording clerk (Schriftführer) of the parents' association (Elternverein) at this school. In protest against the government's cuts in the education budget, the teachers of this school decided, together with the teaching staff of two other schools, to reduce and shorten school trips for the school year 2001/2002. The pupils and some parents, including the applicant, did not agree with these measures. The applicant called for a vote by the School Committee (Schulgemeinschaftsausschuss) of the Grieskirchen secondary school on the question whether the class his son was attending, should go on a one week trip to Tuscany or Prague.

According to the title-deed the applicant’s share corresponded to 275/21672 of the plot. The applicant submitted a copy of a map dated 17 June 1970 where he is mentioned as the owner of the part of the land designated as no. 46 in plot no. 195 (hereinafter “land no. 46”), which was around 329,50 m2 in size. By decision no. 92/5 dated 12 May 1992, the Kadıköy Municipality divided the property amongst its owners and created separate titles. The applicant was allocated the part of the land designated as no. 6 in plot no. 195. It appears that the Municipality allocated parcel no. 46 to a firm.

On 14 February 2000 the Coburg Regional Court convicted the applicant of sexual assault and rape of a hitchhiker with the aid of weapons, committed in August 1999, and sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment. The Regional Court had regard to the fact that the applicant had previously been convicted of sexual offences committed against acquaintances of his on several occasions, partly under the influence of alcohol, namely of two counts of attempted rape in 1978, of rape in 1983 and of sexual assault and another rape in 1989. Having consulted a psychiatric and a psychological expert, the Regional Court considered that the applicant had not suffered from a pathological personality disorder and that his criminal responsibility had not been diminished at the time of the offence.

During their relationship, S.S. gave birth to a boy on 24 June 1998. The child was registered under his mother’s family name. For the first five months the couple raised the child together. Subsequently, the relationship deteriorated and the applicant left their common home. Since the applicant’s parental status had not been resolved legally, he repeatedly initiated proceedings for an official declaration of paternity (teljes hatályú apai elismerő nyilatkozat). However, the mother refused to give her consent to the statement, which is required by law for such a statement to be valid. Moreover, the mother has not allowed the applicant to see the child at all. In January 2000 the applicant brought an action against the child and the mother before the Pest Central D	[3]	2	1	0

S. sought to recover an amount of money advanced to the applicant for construction of a house for him. S. claimed that instead of building the house the applicant had acquired a flat for himself and a new car. The District Court attached the applicant’s flat to secure the claim. On 4 April 2003 the District Court awarded 362,267.87 Russian roubles (RUB) to S., to be paid by the applicant, and issued a writ of execution.

349	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Pskov, a town in the Pskov Region. As a victim of Chernobyl, the applicant is entitled to social benefits. Considering himself underpaid, he brought six successful actions against local authorities responsible for welfare. On 13 August 2002 the Pskov Town Court fixed a new amount of periodic benefits. This judgment became binding on 24 September 2002. According to the Government, this judgment was fully enforced by 31 December 2006. According to the applicant, this judgment has still not been enforced, because from 1 January 2007 the periodic benefits were reduced again. On 11 June 2003 the Town Court awarded 15,000 Russian roubles (“RUB”) as interest for delayed payment. This judgment became binding on 15 July 2003. On the welfare authority’s request, on 20 February 2004 the Presidium of the Pskov Regional Court quashed the judgment on supervisory review, on the ground of misapplication of material law.

350	 The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Ohrid. On 30 December 1993 the applicant concluded a loan agreement (“the agreement”) (договор за одобрување на кредит) with the “Makbanka-BS” A.D. (“the company”), in accordance with which he received a loan in the amount of DM 40,000 (German Marks) under the following conditions: to repay the loan within three months with 8% monthly interest. The applicant took the loan for the benefit of Mr K.S. who had been ineligible to apply due to his poor financial status. On the same date, the then Ohrid Municipal Court entered a notice (“the notice”) in the public register, recording a mortgage in favour of the company over a house and a plot of land owned by the applicant. The principal amount of the loan with interest was paid by Mr K.S. within the three-month period as set forth in the agreement. Despite that fact, the company continued charging 8% interest although the validity of the agreement had not been extended.	[3]	3	1	0

On 12 March 1996 the applicant wrote a report entitled “Civil opinion” (opinia cywilna) on the treatment that Mr J.M. had undergone in the Regional Hepatology Clinic in Tarnów. The opinion described, in a detailed manner, the history of Mr J.M.’s medical treatment since the beginning of the 1980s. The report was based on Mr J.M.’s medical file obtained from the clinics of hepatology and dermatology where he had received treatment. The applicant also relied on the results of a recent medical examination, a biopsy, carried out at the applicant’s initiative by the Cracow University Medical Academy. In his report the applicant established that the patient had been receiving treatment since 1983 at the Tarnów Clinic. However, in spite of the fact that his health had deteriorated and that	[6]	2	1	0

As of late 1998 the applicant has been in receipt of social benefits in this connection. On an unspecified date the applicant sued the Tambov Pension Authority (Управление социальной защиты населения мэрии города Тамбова, “the authority”) seeking to recover the amount of allegedly unpaid social benefits. By judgment of 19 June 2000 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Tambov (“the District Court”) examined and granted the applicant’s action and ordered the authority to pay him the arrears of RUR 10,890.73. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the Tambov Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) on 4 September 2000. It came into force on the same date.

In his speech, delivered during the “First National Construction Conference”, which took place in 1997, the applicant analysed the progress of the work in his field of discipline. He also distributed a paper in which he criticised the way the examinations for assistant professors were being administered. On 17 September 1997, an assistant professor, N.C.A., brought a civil action for compensation against the applicant, before the Şişli Civil Court of First Instance. He claimed that certain remarks used by the applicant in the paper constituted an attack on his reputation, although his name was not mentioned. The statements in question were as follows: “The panel for the assistant professorship examination in the discipline of construction management was formed by academics of the construction faculty.

354	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Rawicz. On 28 April 1995 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery and threats to kill, committed in an organised criminal group carrying out robberies, extorting money by threats and drug trafficking. On 23 May 1995 the Poznań District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. The subsequent decisions of the court of 27 May and 26 June 1995 further extending his detention (by the latter until 27 July 1995) were based on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences and on the severity of the likely sentence. It was also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence or induce witnesses to give false testimony. The applicant was released from a detention centre on 25 July 1995 by the 	[2]	1	1	0
355	 The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Turany. He is a soldier by profession. On 22 May 1997 the applicant's neighbour damaged a fence and entered the applicant's land while fixing the connection of his house pipes to the gas supply in the street. The applicant requested that the neighbour and the workers stop the works as he had not been notified and the neighbour had not shown that he had been authorised to do so. As the neighbour and the workers refused to stop the works, the applicant attempted to prevent them from continuing. The neighbour called the police. Later an employee of the municipal office in Turany asked the applicant to allow the neighbour to fix the connection. As the applicant still prevented the works from being carried out, the police took him, with his consent, to a police station where he was asked to explain his behaviour. On 7 July 1997 the Martin Office of Investigation charged the applicant with an offence in that he had t	[3]	2	1	0

Upon discomfort which emerged straight after the operation, he applied to the hospital where he was operated on and found out that the reason for his complaints was that the operation had not been conducted under the necessary hygienic conditions. On 17 November 2000 he brought a civil case against the Social Security Agency before the Adana 5th Civil Court of General Jurisdiction and claimed damages. On 23 August 2001 the civil court decided that the case was not within its jurisdiction and sent it to the Adana 2nd Labour Court. On 1 June 2001 the applicant brought a new case directly before the labour court in claim of damages. The labour court decided that both cases were out of its jurisdiction since they were not of a labour case nature. Pursuant to the Code of civil procedure, the first case wa	[3]	2	1	0

He was examined by a doctor who found that he was sober. The applicant was immediately released. On 18 November 1998 the applicant sued the local police department for compensation for unlawful arrest. The applicant’s complaint was admitted by the Budennovsk Town Court of the Stavropol Region (“the Town Court”). The first hearing was scheduled for 25 December 1998, but on that date it did not take place. No action was taken on the case until December 2001. On 25 December 2001 the Town Court identified the Ministry of the Interior Affairs as the respondent and involved the local police department as a third party in the proceedings.

On 7 January 2005 the applicant lodged an action against two individuals with the Dolný Kubín District Court seeking an order for payment of an amount of money by way of compensation in respect of what he considered to have been unjustified use of his real property. On 1 October 2007 the District Court heard the case for the first time, but the hearing was adjourned and, on 1 January 2008, the case was transferred to the Námestovo District Court in the context of reorganisation of the judiciary. On 13 May 2009 the case was heard for the second time and the defendant lodged a counter-claim seeking a ruling declaring him to be the owner of the property in question. Subsequently, the applicant’s action was stayed pending the outcome of the proceedings on the counter-claim, which was eventually dismissed with final and binding effect as of 12 December 2011.

On 18 June 1992 the public prosecutor lodged an indictment against him on account of “grievous offences against the general safety” because on 19 October 1991, while employed in a supervisory position at a power supply company and contrary to safety requirements, he did not cut the power supply from the grid of the power line on which Mr B. was carrying out some repair works, causing the latter's death. Between 4 September 1992 and 8 October 1993 the then Gostivar Municipal Court (Општински суд) (“the trial court”) scheduled eight hearings in the course of which it obtained three expert reports, heard evidence from the applicant and witnesses, and carried out an on-site examination.

361	 The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. He is currently residing in Moscow. In January 2005, when the applicant was living in Uzbekistan, a district court in Tashkent convicted him of being a member of the Islamic religious organisation Tablighi Dzhamaat, prohibited in Uzbekistan. The court ordered him to pay a fine in an amount equal to sixty times the minimum monthly wage. The applicant paid the fine and continued to reside in Uzbekistan. However, according to him, he felt constant pressure from the law‑enforcement agencies, which required him to report on all his actions and movements and, in case of delay or failure on his part, threatened to arrest his elder son. So as not to put his family in danger, on 6 December 2005 the applicant left Uzbekistan for Moscow. In the meantime the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan quashed the decision of January 2005 on the ground that the sentence was too mild and remitted the case for fresh exam	[2]	2	1	0
362	 The applicant was born in 1961. In March 1994 the applicant was suspected by police officers in the Cambridge Constabulary of involvement in robbery. The view was taken by the Cambridgeshire Regional Crime Squad that it was necessary to place a hidden battery-powered listening and recording device in the applicant’s home. An application was therefore made to the Chief Constable for the instalment of such a device, which was authorised on 21 June 1994, pursuant to the non-statutory Home Office Guidelines of 1984. In order to install the device, the police decided to arrest the applicant and his partner in connection with another matter (credit card fraud) and to remove them and their children from their home. Enquiries into the credit card fraud had previously lapsed without any arrest or questioning of the applicant or his partner. However, DC Harrison of the Regional Crime Squad and WDC Fletcher, an officer in the intelligence bureau of the Cambridgeshire County 	[4]	2	1	1

Before 1940, the applicant's aunt owned a farm in the Jelgava district which comprised a plot of land, a dwelling house and several farm buildings. The land was nationalised by the Soviet Union in 1940 and the buildings were considered as abandoned. In 1956 a third person bought from the local administration a barn and a wood shelter belonging to the estate; he subsequently converted the barn into a dwelling house. Throughout the Soviet period, most of the estate was kept and operated by a co-operative agricultural society. Following the restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991, the applicant's mother, relying on the new property reform and denationalisation laws, sought the return of both the buildings and the land.

The university claimed that the applicant had presented a falsified curriculum vitae in the framework of a public tender for the allocation of pharmaceutical establishment licences. On 6 February 2004, La Laguna investigating judge no. 1 ordered the suspension of the criminal investigation, considering that there were no objective reasons to believe that the crime had been committed.

The National Bureau of Investigation carried out a pre-trial investigation into the business activities of Porin West-Print Ky. The applicant, who was questioned as a suspect in an alleged tax fraud, proclaimed his innocence. In his closing statement, he expressed the view that other companies, represented by two other named individuals, had carried out the business activities which were the subject of the investigation and were therefore liable to pay tax. The file does not disclose whether anyone was charged with and convicted of the alleged offence. In 1999 the south-west Finland Tax Office carried out a tax inspection into Porin West-Print Ky.

The applicant gives the following account of what happened at the border checkpoint. Before arriving in Croatia, the applicant and another person, K.B., had purchased four cartons of cigarettes and two litres of cooking oil. At the border checkpoint they were approached by a customs officer who asked the applicant if he had anything to declare. The applicant pointed at the purchased goods, lying in the backseat of the car, inviting the customs officer to take a look. The officer then asked the applicant to show him his passport.

397	 The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Mirna. The application concerns two sets of criminal proceedings. In both sets of proceedings, the hearings were closed to the public for the purpose, among others, of protecting the rights of the alleged victims and – as regards some of the hearings – the private life of the applicant. On 13 March 1998 an official police report (uradni zaznamek) was prepared concerning the applicant's attitude towards children he had taught in a primary school. It contained a statement given by one of the school teachers which had been obtained in accordance with section 148/2 of the Criminal Procedure Act (Zakon o kazenskem postopku – see paragraph 44 below).

After leaving the PMOI, he went to the Temporary Interview and Protection Facility (“TIPF”), a camp created by the United States forces in Iraq. This facility was subsequently named the Ashraf Refugee Camp (“ARC”). On 5 May 2006, after being interviewed, the applicant was recognised as a refugee by the UNHCR Headquarters in Geneva during his stay in Iraq.

399	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Bierutów. On 8 March 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of numerous offences of assisting in the forgery of identity documents and aiding illegal border crossing, committed in an organised criminal group. On 10 March 2006 the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence and go into hiding, particularly as he had had at his disposal a number of forged identity documents. The applicant's appeal against the detention order, likewise his further appeals against decisions prolonging his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful.

According to him, he did so against his will under threat of dismissal for disciplinary reasons. He learned of this threat from colleagues, who had heard it from their superior. The pretext for the dismissal was said to be a disciplinary penalty which had been imposed on the applicant on 30 May 2003 for having allegedly failed to act with the requisite diligence when handling an incident involving a helicopter. Following the applicant’s request for early retirement, and pursuant to section 253(1)(2) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act (“the 1997 Act”: see paragraph 15 below), the Minister of Internal Affairs decided to terminate the applicant’s employment.

507	 The applicant was born in 1922 and lives in Frankfurt am Main. In 1948 the applicant and his family left Poland and settled in Israel. His father appointed a representative to deal with all legal and financial matters in Poland. Despite that representative's opposition, in 1965 the State authorities expropriated a part of the property belonging to the applicant's family. The applicant could not take part in the proceedings concerning the expropriation, because the Polish authorities refused to grant him a visa to enter the territory of Poland. On 24 March 1998 the applicant filed with the Łódź Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) an action in which he claimed compensation for the allegedly unlawful use of his estate by the State Treasury. In December 1998 the Łódź District Office (Urząd Rejonowy) filed with the same court an action in which it sought a declaration that the State Treasury had acquired the ownership of that estate on the basis of the 1946 decre	[3]	3	1	0
508	 The applicant is an Azerbaijan citizen who was born in 1971 and currently lives in Biedermansdorf, Austria. The date of the applicant’s arrival in Lithuania was disputed between the parties. The applicant stated that he had lived in Lithuania since 1989, proof of which was the judgment of 1989 of Vilnius City 2nd District Court by which he was found guilty of theft and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. He claimed that after that trial he was not ordered to leave the country. He also noted that he had arrived in Lithuania before the introduction of the visa regime in the early 1990’s, and that therefore his entry had not been illegal. The Government stated that the date of the above-mentioned judgment was not 1989 but 1998, and that the applicant only lawfully entered the territory of Lithuania on 12 March 2001, when he was issued with a single-entry visa.

511	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Belgrade. In 1992 the applicant was dismissed from the job which he held in a local construction company. On 16 June 1992 he filed a claim with the Third Municipal Court in Belgrade (Treći opštinski sud u Beogradu), seeking reinstatement. On 16 June 1993 the Third Municipal Court ruled in favour of the applicant. On 22 September 1993 the District Court in Belgrade (Okružni sud u Beogradu) quashed this judgment and ordered a retrial. From 23 December 1993 to 15 September 1999, the Third Municipal Court ruled in favour of the applicant on six separate occasions, but each time the District Court quashed those judgments on appeal and ordered a retrial.

By a decision of 24 October 2002 the District Court in Wodzisław Śląski remanded him in custody on charges connected with organised crime. It had regard to evidence gathered by the prosecuting authorities which indicated that the applicant had committed the offences concerned. The applicant appealed, to no avail.

The court relied on the evidence gathered in the case which pointed to the likelihood of the applicant's guilt. It was also of the view that the applicant, if released, could hinder the proper course of the investigations and judicial proceedings by exerting pressure on witnesses and by colluding with his co-accused.

540	 The applicant, Mr Artur Bystrowski, is a Polish national who was born in 1963 and lives in Strzelin. On 8 September 2000 the Wrocław District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) detained the applicant on remand on suspicion of having committed theft and forgery and of leadership of an organised criminal gang. Subsequently, the applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended on several occasions. In successive decisions, given on 29 November 2000, 15 February and 7 December 2001, 23 August and 2 October 2002, the court repeatedly relied on the strong probability that the applicant had committed the offences and that there was a real risk that he would receive a severe sentence. This – together with the fact that he had acted in a gang and that there were several co-accused in the case –gave rise to a presumption that he would obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings. In the meantime, on 9 February 2001 a bill of indictment was issued, charging the applicant with multi	[]	2	1	0

On 16 February 1995, the New General Occupational Association (Nieuwe algemene bedrijfsvereniging – “NAB”) rejected his request. On 17 March 1995 the applicant’s lawyer filed an appeal with the Administrative Law Division of the Utrecht Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank). On 27 April 1995 the Registrar to the Utrecht Regional Court informed the applicant’s lawyer that the appeal could only be examined after payment of registration fees amounting to 50 Netherlands Guilders (NLG). On 12 May 1995 the applicant paid these fees, which were received by the Regional Court on 19 May 1995. On 11 August 1995 the Utrecht Regional Court requested the NAB to submit its response to the applicant’s appeal, as well as documents relating to the case.

On the same day the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s detention on the grounds of the risk that he might tamper with evidence and of the gravity of the charges (Article 102 §§ 1(2) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The judge held that it was necessary to question several witnesses who could be influenced by the applicant and the other defendants, and that the pecuniary gain allegedly obtained suggested that the circumstances of the offences were particularly serious. On 22 March 2011 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody. The applic	[2]	2	1	0

The DCS officers then decided to organise a covert operation of the test purchase of the drug. At about 3 p.m. on 6 February 2006 the DCS officers arrived at the applicant’s block of flats and rang at the door of a flat located next to that of the applicant in which two sisters, Ms E.N. and Ms T.N, resided. The DCS officers asked the two women to ring at the applicant’s door so that he would open it unaware of the DCS officers’ presence. Ms E.N. and Ms T.N. refused to cooperate. The DCS officers then waited on the stairway for the applicant to leave the flat. At some point the applicant stepped out of his flat. According to the applicant, three DCS officers forcibly dragged him out of the flat, pushed him to the floor and beat him on the stairway.	[1]	2	1	0

On 29 April 1999 between 8 and 8.30 p.m. the applicant, together with several other individuals, was collecting scrap metal in Harambašićeva Street in Zagreb. Suddenly, two unidentified men approached the group and attacked the applicant. They beat him all over his body with wooden planks, shouting racial abuse. Another two unidentified men, apparently members of the same group, stood close by and kept watch. Shortly afterwards, following a report by an unknown person about the ongoing fight, a police patrol was sent to the scene. The police interviewed the persons on the spot and went up and down the nearby streets attempting to find the attackers. An ambulance arrived and took the applicant to a nearby hospital. The doctors concluded that no bones had been broken, provided the applicant with painkillers and sent him home to rest. During the night the applicant experienced severe pai	[1, 8]	2	1	0
555	 The applicant was born in 1959 and was resident in Siltakylä at the time of his death. At the material time the applicant was the majority owner of a limited liability company providing bakery and café services. The company is not an applicant before the Court. In 1999 the Uusimaa Tax Office carried out a tax inspection of the company’s books for the years 1996-1998. The tax inspector interviewed the applicant and three persons who were working, or had worked, for the company: Mr T.L., Ms H.T. and Mr R.L. He drew up an inspection report dated 2 September 1999 and two inspection letters dated 6 September 1999. He found that there were deficiencies in the company’s book-keeping and that it had failed to enter as income part of the retail sales during the tax years 1996, 1997 and 1998. Basing himself on the company’s turnover, books and the remaining cash register printouts, he estimated the amounts at 140,000 Finnish marks (FIM), FIM 100,000 and FIM 130,000 respecti	[3]	2	1	1

During 1978/1979 the applicant opened two certificates of deposits in foreign currency in the Kocani office of the “Stopanska Banka” Skopje (“the bank”) for a fixed period of 25 months. The terms of the agreement were stated on the cover of the bank account savings card. There was a bank stamp which defined three terms of the deposit: the amount of the savings, the duration of the deposit and the interest rate of 10%. Since the parties did not terminate the agreement after it expired, it was considered that the certificate was extended. Until 1992 the bank continued to pay him interest, but at differing rates. On 18 June 1991 the applicant brought a civil claim against the bank for payment of the difference in the interest rate. He claimed that the bank had applied a lower interest rate than agreed.

The medical panel which examined the applicant at that time did not grant him the right to benefit from a personal care assistant. During the years 2003 to 2009, several sets of criminal proceedings resulting in conviction were brought against the applicant on different charges of embezzlement and fraud. On 10 March 2010 the Bucharest District Court granted the applicant’s request to have the different prison sentences joined, and thereby sentenced him to three years and six months’ imprisonment.

On 9 March 2006 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence. The applicant's appeals against decisions prolonging his detention and all his subsequent, numerous applications for release, were unsuccessful. In the course of the investigation, the applicant's detention was prolonged on several occasions by the Gdańsk Regional Court's (Sąd Okręgowy) decisions delivered on 25 May, 24 August, 16 November and 12 December 2006.

On 25 and 27 April 2006 the applicant was allegedly tortured by police officer I.M. and two other police officers in order to extract a confession from him. According to the applicant, his hands and feet were tied together behind his back and a metal bar from a coat hanger was passed under his arms. The metal bar was placed on two chairs and his body was suspended for more than forty minutes. His hands had been covered with cloth so that no traces of rope would remain on them. Loud music was played so that his cries would not be heard. While being suspended in this manner, his head was covered with a coat and he was beaten with a chair on the back of his head. These acts of brutality were accompanied by verbal and psychological aggression. The Government contested the allegatio	[1]	1	1	0

The Law on Calculating and Upgrading State Pensions of 21 July 1997 (the “Pensions Law”) introduced, since 1 February 1998, a new method of calculating pensions. This method, “Individual Pensioner Coefficient” (“IPC”), was meant to link a person’s pension to his previous earnings. On 22 April 1999 the applicant brought proceedings against the Volgodonsk labour and social development authority (Департамент труда и социального развития) before the Volgodonsk Town Court. He argued that his IPC should be fixed at 0.7, which would result in an increase in his pension. The Town Court found for the applicant and ordered the defendant authority to re-calculate the applicant’s pension from 1 February 1998 based on the IPC equal to 0.7 and pay the arrears of 3,186.36 roubles.

They are both disabled on account of their disease (first degree disability, 100% unfit for work). While they live in Palanca village in Ştefan-Vodă county, they have to travel to Chişinău to receive their haemodialysis treatment. Initially, their transportation costs were covered by the regional hospital. However, starting from early 2004, the hospital no longer covered these expenses.

His article, which was entitled “If the pashas [the generals] refuse to obey”, contained criticisms of high-ranking officers who were about to retire. He hinted that some generals in the armed forces were wont to sound false alarms concerning an alleged advance of fundamentalism and anti-secularism, which they then used as a pretext for interfering in the country’s general politics, and that they appeared to have links with certain business circles, the media, senior civil servants and even the Mafia, endeavouring to create a political atmosphere that tallied with their worldview.

In the same year his family was deported to Russia and to Uzbekistan. On 8 December 1992 the Moldovan Parliament enacted Law No. 1225-XII “on the rehabilitation of the victims of the political repression committed by the totalitarian communist occupying regime”. The Law enabled the victims of the Soviet repression to claim restitution of their confiscated or nationalised property. In 1997 the applicant lodged an action with the Centru District Court (Judecătoria Sectorului Centru) by which he sought the restitution of his parents' house. As the former tenants of the house had purchased it from the State, the applicant sought a judicial ruling declaring the purchase contracts null and void.

On 20 November 2002 the Bydgoszcz District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) issued a “wanted” notice in respect of the applicant in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed a murder and had gone into hiding, thereby defeating attempts by the police to arrest him. The court also decided to remand the applicant in custody for a period of seven days from the date of his arrest. On 13 March 2003 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 17 March 2003 the Toruń Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) extended his detention until 13 June 2003. Subsequently, the Toruń Regional Court extended the applicant's detention on 4 June, 29 August and 8 December 2003.

Shortly after the taxi moved off, it was stopped by four plain-clothes agents of the NDMIA. Without showing themselves, they dragged the applicant into a Jeep. He was not informed of the reasons for his arrest. After his arrest they restrained his hands and only after some time, when the vehicle was moving, did they inform him that they were police officers. According to the applicant, as he was in shock during his arrest, he did not immediately notice that the officers had planted some drugs on him. However, he later realised that one of the officers, A.A., had slipped narcotic substances into his pocket, taking	[3]	2	1	0

He was also suspected of having stolen three high value cars. On the same day the Vilnius City First District Court ordered the applicant’s detention for three months. On 1 April 2004 the Vilnius Regional Court upheld the decision. The courts observed that the applicant was suspected of a very serious crime: belonging to a criminal association since 2001. The charges against him were based on concrete evidence, and there was a risk that if he were not detained he might continue his criminal activities. He also had a prior conviction for disorderly conduct (chuliganizmas), for which he had already served a sentence.

On 29 June 1993 the applicant filed an action with the Zagreb Municipal Court against A.K.M and its owner, A.K for re-payment of his loan in the amount of 70,000 Austrian schillings (ATS). At the preliminary hearing on 22 November 1993 the applicant's counsel withdrew the claim in respect of A.K.M. He also requested leave to file additional submissions within eight days.

On 27 October 2005 the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might induce witnesses to give false testimony. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence and the complex nature of the case.

On 9 September 1996 criminal proceedings were instituted against him and three other defendants before the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätt) of Tuusula. The prosecutor charged two of them with aggravated embezzlement and the applicant and another co-defendant with aiding and abetting the said offence between 9 June and 22 August 1989. The complainant, now a limited liability company to which the ownership of a bank group had been transferred, joined the proceedings and presented an accessory claim for dama	[3]	2	1	1
667	 The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Szydłowiec, Poland. On 17 January 1995 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of robbery. On 18 January 1995 the Przysucha District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) charged him with robbery and detained him on remand on the ground that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. On 13 March 1995 the applicant was indicted before the Radom Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki). The trial began on 17 August 1995. On 11 July 1996 the Radom Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 4 years' imprisonment. On 16 April 1997, on the applicant's appeal, the Warsaw Court of Appeal amended that judgment in part and reduced the sentence to 3 years' and 6 months' imprisonment. On an unknown date the applicant was detained in Radom Remand Centre (Areszt Śledczy). On 18 September 1995 he was placed in a cell of 12.49 square metres together with	[6]	1	1	0
668	 The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Salaspils. The applicant, who had been working as a bailiff (tiesu izpildītājs) since 1996, was arrested and eventually convicted of corruption offences. He was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The events leading up to the final decision adopted by the Senate of the Supreme Court on 17 March 2006 unfolded as follows. On 9 November 2001, following a request by a private company, R.L., for its claim to be secured in a commercial dispute with another private company, M., a court issued an order for M.’s moveable property to be seized. On 15 November 2001 the director of R.L., O.V., submitted a writ of execution of the said decision to the Riga City Vidzeme District Bailiffs’ Office (Rigas pilsētas Vidzemes priekšpilsētas Tiesu izpildītāju kantoris).

669	 The applicant was born in 1955 and is serving a sentence of imprisonment in the Sverdlovsk Region. The applicant was arrested on 20 January 1998. He was charged with a number of criminal offences, including conspiracy to commit murder. On 11 May 1998 the applicant was taken to remand centre no. 77/1, also known as “Matrosskaya Tishina”. In July 1998 the deputy Prosecutor General extended his detention until 18 January 1999. On 2 October 1998 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court of Moscow upheld this extension order. In September 2000 the criminal case against the applicant was listed for trial. On 29 September 2000 the Moscow City Court held that the measure of restraint in respect of defendants, including the applicant, had been lawful and should remain unchanged. The City Court subsequently issued further extension orders on 3 July, 30 September, 18 December 2002, 24 March, 30 June and 30 September 2003, referring to the fact that the a	[2, 3]	2	1	0
670	 The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant, who was born in 1986, claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom at the age of three years old. However, there is no official record of his presence until 1994, when he was eight years old. He first came to the notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department on 21 December 1994, when the family court sought clarification of the applicant’s immigration status, while considering an application for a residence order in respect of the applicant by his aunt. The applicant’s aunt made an application for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom, on the basis of her long stay, and with the applicant listed as her dependant, on 24 January 2003. While this application was under consideration, a further application for indefinite leave was made on behalf of the applicant by Southwark Social Services. This application stated that the applicant had been thrown 	[]	0	1	1
671	 The applicant was born in 1929 and lives in Pula, Croatia. On 3 May 1991 his goods stored in a kiosk in Zadar, Croatia, were damaged by unknown perpetrators. On 16 June 1992 he instituted civil proceedings before the Zadar Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zadru) seeking damages from the Republic of Croatia and an insurance company for his damaged property. On 17 May 1999 the Zadar Municipal Court stayed the proceedings in respect of the Republic of Croatia pursuant to the Civil Obligations (Amendments) Act 1996 (Zakon o izmjeni Zakona o obveznim odnosima). On the same date it decided to separate the proceedings in respect of the insurance company. On 16 May 2002 the Zadar Municipal Court rejected the applicant’s claim against the insurance company. The applicant did not appeal. The proceedings in respect of the Republic of Croatia resumed on 5 December 2003 pursuant to the “Damage from Terrorist Acts and Public Demonstrations Act 2003” (Z	[3]	3	1	0
672	 The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Pleven. On 3 April 1992 the applicant was appointed general manager of the state-owned company Republika EOOD (“the company”) under a contract executed between him and the Ministry of Industry (“the Ministry”). On 30 June 1995 the applicant signed a new contract with the Ministry pursuant to which he was to remain the general manger of the company until 1998. On 25 July 1995 the Ministry rescinded the latter contract and the applicant had to leave the position of a general manager. Believing the rescission to have been unlawful, on 16 August 1995 the applicant brought an action before the Sofia City Court, seeking remuneration under the contract of 1995. The action was directed against the company as a main defendant and the Ministry of Industry (“the Ministry”) as an additional defendant in the event of dismissal of the action against the company.

673	 The applicant was born in Lyons in 1962 and lives in Villeurbanne. The applicant lived in France from his birth until 28 February 1995 with all the members of his family, his father and mother and his four brothers and sisters. On 14 May 1986 he married an Italian national who, according to him, now has French nationality, and three children of French nationality were born of the marriage. Following his arrest for offences under drugs legislation (cannabis resin) in December 1989, the applicant was sentenced on 22 January 1991 to six years’ imprisonment. On 4 July 1991 the Lyons Court of Appeal upheld the sentence and ordered the applicant’s permanent exclusion from French territory. After both the Lyons Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation had dismissed his application for the exclusion order to be lifted, the applicant submitted an application (no. 25017/94) on 25 August 1994 to the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”	[]	0	1	1
674	 The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in the Rostov Region. On 9 June 1999 the applicant obtained a judgment of the Shakhty Town Court of the Rostov Region by which social-security authorities were to pay him a certain amount in respect of previously unpaid emoluments. In 2002, the applicant received the amount due under the judgment. On 13 December 2006 the applicant and the Shakhty Department of Labour and Social Development entered into a friendly settlement, according to which the Department was to pay the applicant compensation of 1,500 euros (“EUR”) for the delay in enforcement of the above judgment. In exchange, the applicant was to abandon his claims relating to untimely payments. On the same date the Shakhty Town Court approved the settlement. On 26 December 2006 the Town Court's judgment became final. On 29 December 2006 the applicant informed the Court that the amount of EUR 1,500 had been credited into his bank account.	[4]	2	1	0
675	 The applicant was born in 1914 and lived in Ljubljana. He died in 2008. On 1 September 1970 a decision by which the applicant’s house was expropriated in favour of the Municipality of Ljubljana became final. In 1971, the municipality instituted non-contentious court proceedings to determine the amount of compensation due for the expropriated property. The applicant was a party to those proceedings. By 1988, the first-instance court had ruled on the matter four times due to three remittals of the case by the second-instance court. The last judgment of the first-instance court, issued on 15 July 1988, was quashed by the Ljubljana Higher Court on 2 March 1989. The latter found that the facts had been insufficiently established. It ordered a re-examination of the case by the first-instance court. In 1989 the proceedings were suspended pending the outcome of another set of proceedings in which the applicant challenged the validity of the expropriation	[3]	3	1	0
676	 The applicant was born in 1971. Prior to his arrest he was residing in the Moscow Region. On an unspecified date in 1999 the applicant arrived in Russia and settled in Moscow. Between 1 and 18 November 2009 he travelled to Uzbekistan (see paragraphs 43-44 below). It appears from the domestic judgment of 18 September 2013 (see paragraph 39 below) that he was registered with the local migration authorities from 20 November 2009 to 18 February 2010. On 3 March 2010 the National Security Department of the Samarkand Region of Uzbekistan brought criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of his alleged membership between 1990 and 1998 of Hizb ut‑Tahrir (“HT”), a transnational Islamic organisation, banned in Russia, Germany and some Central Asian republics, and making public calls to overthrow the constitutional order of Uzbekistan and to establish an Islamic state in its place. On 6 April 2010 the applicant was charged in absentia in Uzbekistan wit	[1, 2]	2	1	0
677	 The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Kraków. The applicant is a doctor, specialising in cardiac surgery. He is one of the few specialists in Poland qualified to perform heart transplants. At the relevant time he was the Director of the Cardiac Surgery Clinic in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration Hospital in Warsaw and an assistant professor at the Jagiellonian University Medical College in Kraków. Following information submitted by doctors employed in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration Hospital, on 12 December 2006 the Warsaw Regional Prosecution Office instituted an investigation into cases of alleged medical negligence and several counts of harassment of hospital staff by the applicant. It appears that the applicant was also suspected of receiving bribes from his patients. On 12 February 2007 the applicant arrived at work at about 7 a.m. and started preparing for an operation which was planned for that morning. 	[2]	2	1	0
678	 The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Switzerland. In 1990 the applicant fled from Iran to Turkey to escape arrest by the Iranian authorities for assisting a member of the People's Mojahedin Organisation of Iran (“the PMOI”) to flee Iran. In early 1991 he crossed the border from Turkey to Iraq and joined the PMOI there. In Iraq the applicant lived in the Al-Ashraf camp, where PMOI members were accommodated. In 2003 or 2004 he left the PMOI, as he no longer agreed with its goals and methods. After his departure from the Al-Ashraf camp, he went to the Temporary Interview and Protection Facility (“the TIPF”), a camp created by the United States forces near Al‑Ashraf. On 12 September 2007 the applicant applied to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (“the UNHCR”) in Iraq for refugee status. In April 2008, however, before he could be interviewed by the UNHCR and possibly granted refugee status, the TIPF was closed down and the applicant was 	[2]	2	1	0
679	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Murmansk. The applicant brought proceedings against the Murmansk Regional branch of the Pension Fund (“the initial respondent”) seeking to have his pension recalculated in view of the fact that he worked in the Far North of Russia and had become entitled to preferential conditions of retirement. The applicant relied on the provisions of the 1993 Act on Guarantees and Compensations for Persons Working and Residing in the Far North (“the Far North Act”). The respondent authority disagreed, stating that provisions of the Pensions Act (in force as of 1 January 2002) were to be applied and that those provisions did not contain any basis for the requested increase. On 10 June 2002 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Murmansk (“the District Court”) granted the applicant’s claim and found that the Far North Act remained in force and was applicable to the dispute at stake. The court ordered the Murmansk Regional Department of the P	[3, 9]	2	1	0

He was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment. In May 1980 (or November 1979, according to the applicant's submissions), he was released on life licence after a positive recommendation from the Parole Board. In June 1981, the applicant killed a 75 year old woman. His plea of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted by the court. In January 1982 a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment was imposed by the judge having regard to the extreme danger to the public posed by the applicant. At the same time, the court revoked his life licence concerning his earlier sentence of mandatory life imprisonment. In December 1985, the applicant was transferred to the hospital wing of Parkhurst prison. Since then, he has been transferred into ordinary prison loc	[2]	2	1	1
681	 The applicant was born in 1981 and lives in the Russian Federation. On 5 December 2002 the applicant was stopped by the police at a bus station in Odessa, Ukraine, and detained in a holding facility for vagrants (приймальник-спецрозподільник) on the grounds that he had no identity documents with him. According to the applicant, he was detained and held alternately in the aforementioned facility and the Kakhovka, Kherson and Mykolayiv police detention facilities until 23 December 2002, and was questioned off the record about his alleged involvement with a terrorist group plotting to instigate a revolt to reinstate a communist state. During those question sessions the applicant was beaten and tortured. According to the documents on file, on 9 December 2002 the applicant was examined by B., a medical specialist of the Odessa holding facility for vagrants, who noted that he had no bodily injuries. Subsequently (on 14 December 2002) the applicant was taken to 	[1, 3]	1	1	0

On 6 February 1997 the applicant was taken into police custody. In his statement, he explained that he supported the Iranian regime and that he longed for a regime that was based on the Koran. On 13 February 1997 the applicant was questioned by the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court. During his questioning by the prosecutor, the applicant repeated his police statement. On the same day the applicant was brought before the investigating judge attached to the Ankara State Security Court and he was subsequently placed in detention on remand.

683	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Lublin, Poland. On 1 February 1999 the Bielsko-Biała District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that, acting in an organised group, he had committed fraud. The applicant appealed against this decision, but on 19 March 1999 the Bielsko‑Biała Regional Court dismissed the appeal, finding that his detention was necessary to ensure the proper course of the proceedings. On 13 April 1999 the Lublin Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy), to which the case was in the meantime transferred, further prolonged the applicant’s detention. The court relied in particular on the complexity of the case, the need to obtain expert opinions and the seriousness of the charges against the applicant. In addition, the court considered that there existed a danger that the applicant, if released, would obstruct the process of collection of evidence. The applicant appealed. On 20 May 1	[2]	2	1	0
684	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Bucharest. As a member of the Association of Italians of Romania, he stood as a candidate in the parliamentary elections of 26 November 2000 for the Italian Community of Romania, one of the organisations representing the Italian minority in Romania. That organisation submitted a single-candidate list containing the applicant’s name in nineteen of the forty-two constituencies. Once the votes had been counted, the Central Electoral Office decided, on the basis of Article 4 of Law no. 68/1992 on elections to the Chamber of Deputies and to the Senate (“Law no. 68/1992”), to allocate the parliamentary seat belonging to the Italian minority to the Italian Community of Romania, which had secured 21,263 votes at national level.

A committee of experts assessed the value of the plot and the relevant amount was paid to him when the expropriation took place. Following the applicant’s request for increased compensation, on 20 March 1998 the Antalya Civil Court of First-instance awarded him additional compensation plus interest at the statutory rate. On 16 June 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment. On 20 December 1999 the Antalya Civil Court of First-instance awarded the applicant an additional compensation of 3,184,691,136 Turkish liras (TRL) plus interest at the statutory rate applicable at the date of the court’s decision running from 18 December 1997, the date on which the title deed to the land had been transferred to the General Directorate of National Airports.

In a writ served on the tenant on 7 December 1983, the applicant reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Rome Magistrate. By a decision of 10 March 1984, which was made enforceable on 11 April 1984, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 30 June 1984. On 9 January 1986, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises. On 30 January 1986, he informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 20 February 1986. Between 20 Februa	[3, 9]	3	1	1

In a writ served on the tenant on 7 January 1992, the applicant informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term and summoned him to appear before the Rome Magistrate. By a decision of 14 April 1992, which was made enforceable on 24 June 1992, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 30 June 1995. On 25 July 1995, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises. On 4 September 1995 he informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 5 October 1995.

He was registered at the Birth Register as having “Stanisław F.” as father, i.e. a fictitious name, consisting of the applicant’s first name and the mother’s surname. In April 1994 the relationship ended. B.F. left the child with the applicant and disappeared for over a month. The applicant submits a copy of a letter, in which B.F. states that she leaves him and the boy and that they should now fend for themselves. As the child subsequently fell ill, the applicant took him to a hospital. B.F. took D. from the hospital on 21 May 1994. She then stayed in hiding for several months. Since then the applicant has not had any contacts with the child. Prior to this, on 18 April 1994, the applicant lodged a motion with the Gdańsk District Court, claiming that the paternity of D. be established and submitting that he was	[4]	2	1	0

During the questioning the police officers allegedly beat him on his head, chest and legs, seeking to obtain self-incriminating evidence. Afterwards the applicant was placed in a preliminary detention cell. The officer on duty was allegedly instructed not to let the applicant go to the toilet and not to give him anything to drink, notwithstanding the applicant’s argument that he suffered from diabetes insipidus which, in case of dehydration, could provoke an abrupt deterioration in his health.

733	 The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in County Antrim. On 6 January 1996 the applicant’s son, Mr James McDonnell, was remanded in custody to Crumlin Road Prison in Belfast. Since that prison had to close, all prisoners were to be transferred on 30 March 1996 to HMP Maghaberry. On the morning of 30 March and prior to his transfer, Mr McDonnell was informed that his father had died suddenly during the night. Upon hearing the news, the applicant asked to be moved to a single cell. At 10.50 a.m. he was transferred to HMP Maghaberry. His cell was not ready on arrival so he waited in the recreation area. When a prisoner officer informed him that he would share a cell, Mr McDonnell said that he would wreck it. A principal officer was informed.

The applicant participated in the proceedings as the injured party (oštećenik). On 19 July 2000 the Split County Court delivered a judgment finding the first four accused guilty while acquitting D.Š. It also instructed the applicant to pursue his claim for non-pecuniary damage against the four accused in separate civil proceedings. Following an appeal by the State Attorney, on 5 December 2002 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) reversed the lower-instance judgment in the part concerning the first four accused by acquitting them, as their prosecution had become time-bar	[3]	3	1	0
735	 The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Istanbul. At approximately 11 p.m. on 24 August 1995, a police car stopped outside the shop run by the applicant in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Three police officers got out of the car and asked the applicant to remove the letters “DHKP/C” (the abbreviation for the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party/Front, an illegal organisation) written on a wall, two shops down the road from the applicant’s shop. When the applicant refused to comply with that request and told the police officers that it was not his wall and therefore he had no obligation to clean it up, the police officers started to beat him. A number of other police officers, who were driving in the area at the time, also stopped and took part in the beating. The police officers then took the applicant into custody where they continued to beat him in order to force him to sign statements, confessing to the offence of obstructing the police in the course of the	[1]	2	1	0
736	 The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Lubin. In 1973 he had a car accident. On 28 February 1977 the Lubin District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) granted the applicant a life disability pension payable by the insurer, Polish Insurance Establishment (Polski Zakład Ubezpieczeń), in the amount of 1,000 old Polish zlotys a month. The insurer did not pay the applicant’s disability pension for the years 1995 to 2000. Following a complaint by the applicant in 2000, the insurer paid him the amount of 30.94 Polish zlotys (PLN), which at the relevant time was the equivalent of 7.50 euros. The applicant unsuccessfully requested several times that his pension be index linked. On 30 September 2004 the applicant lodged a civil claim against the insurer. He sought the indexed pension for the years 1995-2000. The value of his claim amounted to PLN 30,480. On 15 October 2004 the applicant requested the court to exempt him from the court fee.

On an unspecified date the applicant instituted proceedings in the Tsentralno-Gorodskoy District Court of Gorlovka (“the court”) against the Tsentralno-Gorodskoy District Military Enlistment Office of Gorlovka (“the enlistment office”) claiming payment of a single-payment allowance due to him, compensation for non-pecuniary damage and 51 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in compensation for the court fees. While the proceedings were still pending, the enlistment office paid the allowance. Therefore, the applicant withdrew his claims regarding payment of the allowance and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On 24 April 2003 the court awarded the applicant UAH 51[1] in compensation for the court fees, to be paid by the enlistment office. The judgment was not appealed against and became fi	[3, 9]	1	1	0
738	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in the Tyumen Region. In 1999 he brought a court action against the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. He sought to recover the monetary value of the state-issued promissory notes for the purchase of a Russian-made car. By judgment of 6 March 2001 the Armizonskiy District Court of the Tyumen Region awarded the applicant 38,368.92 Russian roubles (RUR) and recovered in his favour RUR 673 in compensation for court fee. The District Court specified that those amounts had to be paid by the Ministry of Finance at the expenses of the Treasury of the Russian Federation.

739	 The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Lębork, Poland. In the evening of 12 November 1996 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of attempted extortion committed earlier on that day. On 14 November 1996 the Lębork District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) detained him on remand until 12 February 1997. It observed that the evidence obtained so far indicated that there was a great likelihood that the offence in question had been committed by the applicant. Further, it noted that the victim of the crime gave detailed testimony which he confirmed during the confrontation with the applicant. The placing of the applicant in detention was also justified by the severity of the anticipated penalty and the risk of the applicant’s going into hiding and attempting to influence witnesses. With regard to the risk of going into hiding, the District Court emphasised that in connection with the second set of proceedings (see below), the police had been looking for the applicant for ove	[2]	1	1	0

His appeal against the remand order was dismissed on 22 March 1996 by the Jelenia Góra Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki). In March 1996 the prosecutor ordered expert opinions on tool mark identification and microtraces. On 16 May 1996 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court prolonged the applicant’s detention until 31 August 1996, considering, inter alia, that the number of suspected persons and the translation of certain documents from German into Polish made it impossible to complete the proceedings within the originally fixed three month time-limit. On 5 June 1996 the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed the applicant’s appeal against that decision.

742	 In the autumn of 1995, as part of a large-scale investigation into taxicab operators, the Tax Authority (skattemyndigheten) of the County of Stockholm carried out a tax audit of the applicant's taxi firm. Having discovered in the course of the audit certain irregularities in the tax returns for the assessment year 1994, the Tax Authority drafted an audit report on 1 December 1995 containing a supplementary tax assessment and invited the applicant to submit comments. The applicant challenged the report and requested that further investigative measures be carried out. Having regard to the findings of the audit and the applicant's observations, the Tax Authority – by decisions of 22 and 27 December 1995 – increased the applicant's liability to income tax by 286,859 Swedish kronor (SEK), to value-added tax (mervärdesskatt) by SEK 192,866 and to employer's contributions (arbetsgivaravgifter) by SEK 253,783.

It is not clear whether he participated directly in the war between Iran and Iraq. On 25 April 1987 he deserted and fled to Turkey, where he arrived on 5 May 1987. It appears that the applicant stayed for some time in Turkey and then in Greece. He arrived in Denmark on 20 August 1989 and applied for asylum. Pursuant to the practice of the Danish immigration authorities at that time, all asylum-seekers from Iran who, due to desertion from the army, had left their home country before the armistice between Iran and Iraq in the summer of 1988 were granted a residence permit. Accordingly, on 12 October 1990 the applicant was granted a residence and work permit. On 25 August 1994 the residence permit became permanent.

On 29 May 2003 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of robbery and the murder of a taxi driver. On 30 May 2003 the Braniewo District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided to remand the applicant in custody, relying on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and the high probability that a heavy sentence would be imposed on him. The court further considered that there was a risk that the applicant might interfere with the course of the proceedings and bring pressure to bear on witnesses. The applicant's pre-trial detention was subsequently extended on several occasions. On 30 June 2005 the Elbląg Regional Court convicted the applicant and his co‑accused and sentenced them to twenty-five years' imprisonment. The applicant lodged an appeal against the 	[2, 3]	2	1	0

The Yugoslav Army was the single army on the territory of former Yugoslavia governed by laws which were applicable throughout former Yugoslavia. The applicant, as an officer of the Yugoslav Army, paid monthly contributions from his salary to the Yugoslav Army for the construction of army apartments. All army servicemen were entitled to live in army apartments as tenants. The applicant, as an army serviceman, used to live until 1982 as a tenant in an apartment owned by the former Yugoslav Army in Skopje. Once he started working for the Macedonian Secretary of Defence, he sought to obtain a bigger apartment. On 	[9]	3	1	0

His tasks included sending samples of imported products to laboratories for further examination. The examination fees were paid directly to the laboratories by the importers. On 22 July 1999 a company from Vinica (“the company”), which imported goods on a regular basis, presented a shipment for inspection at the border post. Mr A., the owner and manager of the company, allegedly agreed with the applicant to meet on 26 July 1999. According to Mr A., they met on 27 July 1999, when the applicant told him that he could pay the examination fees directly to the applicant, who would then send fewer samples for inspection. As he suspected that the applicant was actually demanding a bribe, Mr A. reported the matter to the police. The police then suggested that he should offer the applicant a sum of money in banknotes which they had 	[]	2	1	0

They then met up with a group of youths, including Z., B.C., B.B. and G., who were also under the influence of alcohol. The two groups started a quarrel which ended with a short fight. According to the applicant, when he and his friends left the scene of the fight nobody was seriously hurt. He just had some bruises on his face. However, it appears that during the fight or immediately afterwards G. was stabbed with a knife. He was taken to hospital, where he died. On the next day the applicant was questioned, charged with the murder of G. and detained in custody pending the investigation. The police searched the scene of the incident, the applicant’s house, and seized his clothes. The clothes were then sent to a forensic expert, who concluded that red stains on the applicant’s	[3]	1	1	0

On 26 January 2004 the Szczecin District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence and go into hiding. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence. In the course of the investigation, his detention was extended several times. In their decisions the courts referred to the reasons previously given and the likelihood that he had committed the offences in an organised criminal group. Further, they referred to the complexity of the case and the fact that many suspects were involved and some of them had not yet been arrested. They s	[2]	1	1	0

It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence or induce witnesses to give false testimony. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence. The applicant's appeal against the detention order, likewise his further appeals against some of the decisions extending his detention and his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful.

766	 The applicant was born in 1953 and is serving his sentence in correctional colony no. 2 in the Astrakhan Region. On 9 May 2012 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder committed during a fight with the victim. Two days later the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan authorised his remand in custody, having noted the gravity of the charges, his previous convictions, including for violent crimes, his failure to “get on the road to improvement”, the absence of an “official” source of income, and his lack of dependants. That decision was upheld on appeal by the Astrakhan Regional Court, which fully endorsed the District Court’s reasoning. In addition, the Regional Court took into account that the applicant was suffering from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but stated that there was no medical evidence that he could not continue being detained in the conditions of a temporary detention facility.

On 16 October 1998 he was brought before the Tarnowskie Góry District Court (Sąd Rejonowy), which ordered that he be remanded in custody until 15 January 1999. The court considered that the applicant’s detention was justified by the existence of strong evidence against him, the gravity of the charges and the severity of the anticipated penalty. His two alleged accomplices were subject to police supervision. On 29 October 1998 the Tarnowskie Góry District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) refused the applicant’s application for release. He considered that keeping him in detention was necessary because an investigation was pending and the police still needed to collect evidence against him. The Katowice Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okręgowy) upheld that decision on 20 November 1998. On 8 Janua	[2]	2	1	0

In July 1998 the applicant purchased a flat on the ground floor of an apartment building with a view to opening there a shop. In August 1998 he started construction works there with a view of tailoring the flat to commercial needs. On several occasions in 1998-1999 the local administration fined the applicant for unauthorised construction. In 1999 the police instituted criminal proceedings against him in this respect, but in 2000 the court acquitted him. The court found that the applicant had carried out works without a relevant permission. However, in the court's opinion, it did not amount to a criminal offence. The flat bought by the applicant belonged to the category of “living premises”, and could not be used for other purposes than providing housing. In order to function as a shop, the flat had to be officially re-classified as “non-residential premises”. With tha	[3, 9]	2	1	0

On 7 September 1995 the public prosecutor charged the applicant and the managing director of company X before the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) with two counts of aggravated tax fraud and two counts of tax fraud, as they had allegedly produced false invoices to the Turku County Tax Office (lääninverovirasto, länsskatteverket). They were also charged with an accounting offence (count 9), as they had allegedly entered false data in the accounts of X. The prosecutor claimed that the applicant was responsible for the offences together with the managing director as, even though he did not have an official status in the management of the company, he had in fact participated in its management. In the indictment dated 12 June 1995, count 1, for example, read as follows: “Aggravated tax fraud.

784	 The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Salzburg. The case concerns criminal charges against the applicant and other persons for participating in a so-called “carousel fraud” scheme. Such a scheme, in which at least three seemingly unconnected undertakings in different countries cooperate to defraud the exchequer, entails selling cheap products at an artificially high price to a domestic trader. The seller charges turnover tax on the price and would normally have to pay the tax to the exchequer. The trader would then export the goods. Since export sales are exempt from turnover tax, the trader could claim reimbursement of the turnover tax he had paid to the seller. However, the seller had never paid the tax to the exchequer, and – in cases where the scheme is successful – the trader receives reimbursement, and the seller receives turnover tax he has not paid to the exchequer.

In the context of these proceedings the applicant had been detained on remand between 10 June and 15 July 2002. It does not appear that he ever complained about this detention before the competent authorities at the domestic level. At around 5 p.m. on 8 December 2001 K., a neighbourhood police inspector, and police officer S., the Deputy Head of the 28th Section of the St Petersburg Central District Department of the Interior (“the District Department of the Interior”), arrived at the applicant’s apartment to request him to attend an i	[1, 2, 4]	2	1	0

He submitted that he had lived in Kirkuk in the Tameem province in northern Iraq. He had been in a relationship with a young Sunni woman for one year. Since the woman’s brothers had not approved of him, they had kept their relationship secret. In June 2007, however, the woman’s brothers had caught them hugging and had attacked the applicant with scissors. During the attack, the woman had fled and he had not seen her since. The woman’s brothers had said that he had offended their honour and that it would only be restored if they killed him. The applicant had been hospitalised for one week and had initially been protected by the police. During that time, the woman’s brothers had burnt down his shop.

The building plan envisaged, inter alia, the construction of a swimming pool on top of the building. The applicant objected to the issuing of the building permit. On 23 May 2006 the Municipal Council of Samedan rejected the objection. The applicant lodged a motion with the administrative court of the canton of Graubünden which was rejected by judgment of 27 November 2006.

On 4 June 1997 the Dudinka Town Court reinstated the applicant in his position as the head of a permanent commission of the Taymyr District Legislative Assembly and awarded him wage arrears and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. That judgment was upheld on appeal and became final on 5 November 1997. Enforcement proceedings were instituted, but on 16 December 1997 a deputy Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, Mr Davydov, suspended the enforcement proceedings and notified the Dudinka Town Court of his decision.

By decision of 17 November 1998 the Hard municipality granted a request by H., a building company, for permission to construct an apartment block, situated next to the applicant’s property. H. carried out the construction work and, since the building deviated from one of the authorised height levels by 21 centimetres, it requested an amendment of the building permit on 19 November 1999. On 7 February 2000 the mayor of Hard granted the amended building permit. He dismissed the applicant’s objection that the ramp of the building’s underground car park failed to comply with the statutory distance from his property. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Hard Municipal Council (Gemeinderat) on 23 February 2000.

By a judgment of 26 October 1992 the Court of Magistrates (as a court of criminal judicature) found the applicant guilty of a series of offences of receiving stolen goods, but acquitted him of the theft of those goods, holding that it was clear that he had had nothing to do with the thefts. The court found it curious that the applicant had given a detailed explanation as to the origin of each item, and yet a number of the victims of the thefts had identified the objects as belonging to them. During the investigation stage the applicant had admitted to the police that because of his fascination with antiques, he would purchase items even though he would have been aware that they had been stolen.

After having held several hearings and obtained the opinions of experts, on 14 November 2007 the Budapest Regional Court delivered its judgment, finding that the respondent was liable for the damages sought. It partly upheld the counter-claim of the respondent and ordered the applicant to pay usage fees for the flat. On 15 January 2008 the Budapest Court of Appeal, sitting as a second-instance court, increased the amount to be paid to the applicant. On 26 June 2008, the Supreme Court, acting as a review instance, decreased the amount to be paid to the applicant and increased the amount of usage fees to be paid to the respondent.	[3]	2	1	0

The applicant claimed that his parents’ marital property included a collection of 300 valuable paintings worth approximately 460,000 Polish zlotys (PLN). The applicant’s father’s second wife contested the fact that the paintings belonged to the estate in question and submitted that they were her own assets.

According to section 9, subsection 1, of the Act on Unemployment Benefits (työttömyysturvalaki, lag om utkomstskydd för arbetslösa), if an unemployed person’s own behaviour has caused an employment contract not to be concluded, he or she has no right to unemployment benefit for two months. According to the Social Insurance Institution, the applicant’s own behaviour had meant that the intended employment contract, which was to last for more than five days, had not been concluded on 4 September 2000. As the applicant had not given a valid reason for not accepting the work offered to him, the benefit was refused. On 26 October 2000 the applicant ap	[3]	2	1	1

858	 The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Łuków. On 9 August 1996 the applicant commenced his compulsory military service, which lasted until 20 October 1997. During his service he suffered a serious spinal injury.  A series of medical tests carried out by military doctors showed that the applicant’s disability had been caused by an ailment which he had had during his childhood. Difficult tasks which he had had to carry out during his military service had made his condition worse. On 31 May 2000 the applicant requested the Social Security Authority (ZUS) to grant him a disability pension (renta inwalidzka).  By a decision of 20 September 2000 the Social Security Authority refused. By a judgment of 13 March 2002 the Siedlce Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The applicant appealed.

On 30 May 2002 the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It further considered that there was a risk that he would induce the co-accused to give false testimony or obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings by destroying the documentary evidence relevant to the investigation; at the time of his arrest the applicant was found to be destroying documents which might be important for the further conduct of the proceedings. The court also stressed the likelihood that a heavy penalty would be imposed on him. On 6 June 2002 the applicant appealed unsuccessfully against the detention order.

On 31 March 2000 the applicant filed submissions with the court claiming that he should also be a party to these proceedings because already in 1983 he had bought the plot of land in question from R.Š., although he was not immediately entered as the owner in the land registry. However, he had been in possession of that plot of land ever since. By the Rab Municipal Court judgment of 27 December 1991 the applicant was established as the owner and on 6 March 1998 he applied to the same court to enforce that	[3]	2	1	0

On 17 May 1999 the applicant was remanded in custody by the Brzeg District Court. The decision was based on a reasonable suspicion, confirmed by testimonies of the victims and of other suspects, that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, the severity of the sentence he faced and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation. The court pointed to a serious risk that the applicant, if not detained, might attempt to influence the co-accused and the victims.

984	 In January 1967 the applicant was convicted of murder. He was released on licence in April 1979. His licence required him to cooperate with his probation officer and to remain in the United Kingdom unless his probation officer agreed to his travelling abroad. Soon after release the applicant left the United Kingdom in breach of his licence and went to live in South Africa. In September 1980 his licence was revoked and thereafter he was continuously “unlawfully at large”. In April 1989 the applicant was arrested in the United Kingdom, having returned from South Africa in possession of a false passport. Possession of a false passport led to a fine. He remained in custody, however, due to the revocation of the life licence. He made written representations to the Parole Board against the 1980 decision to recall him to prison but the Board rejected those representations and recommended a further review in July 1990. In November 1990 the Board recommended t	[2]	0	1	1

988	 The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Sundborn. On 8 September 2009 the Enforcement Authority (Kronofogdemyndigheten) in Falun issued a writ of execution (beslut om utmätning) attaching a mobile sawmill belonging to the applicant. It noted that the applicant’s total enforceable tax debts amounted to SEK 246,199 (roughly EUR 27,300) and that the sawmill had an estimated value of SEK 300,000 (roughly EUR 33,400). The Authority decided to leave the sawmill in the applicant’s possession but informed him that he was not allowed to sell or dispose of it or otherwise make use of it in a way that might negatively affect its value. The applicant appealed against the decision to the District Court (tingsrätten) of Falun and also requested the Enforcement Authority to stay the sale of the sawmill while the court considered the case.

At the time, a master plan (yleiskaava, generalplan) had been drawn up for the area but it had not reached the town planning stage. On 17 June 1996 they sold the property for 210,000 Finnish marks (FIM) (some 35,420 euros) (EUR). The buyer was a company which was to be set up later and it was represented by the applicant. On 26 August 1996 the city decided to use its first call on the property, since it had already negotiated the purchase of the surrounding properties and the purchase price was considered advantageous. On 24 September 1996 the applicant challenged the city’s decision. On 2 May 1997 the Uusimaa County Administrative Court (lääninoikeus, länsrätten) rejected his appeal, finding that pursuant to the Pre-emption Act (etuostolaki, förköpslagen; Act n	[3]	2	1	1

In April 2005, the applicant published an article in a local newspaper concerning the political orientation of the Berger-88-e.V. association (“the  association”). Subsequently, the newspaper published the association’s response to that article describing the applicant’s statements as “intellectually weak and crude” (“geistig schwach und primitiv”) and as “pamphlets constituting a public danger” (“gemeingefährliche Pamphelete”). The newspaper also published two letters to the editor. One of them was written by F.G., an elected town councillor, who contended that the association had no extreme right-wing tendencies (“keine  rechtsradikale Vereinigung”).

In 1998 the applicant sued Mr T. for damages. On 26 November 2001 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Tomsk held for the applicant. Mr T. was absent from this hearing because he did not live at the address to which the summons had been mailed. On 10 December 2001 the applicant collected the writ of enforcement from the court and submitted it to bailiffs for enforcement. On 13 February 2003 the bailiffs returned the writ to the applicant, because it contained wrong information on Mr T.’s identity. The applicant asked the court to rectify Mr T.’s identity, and on 23 December 2003 the court issued a new writ of enforcement. On 30 December 2003 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings and on 26 January 2004 they attached Mr T.’s at in Tomsk. On 17 September 2	[]	3	1	0

On 12 June 1999 the Wrocław District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, the seriousness of the charges against him and the risk that he might tamper with evidence or go into hiding. On 2 September 1999 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) extended the applicant’s detention until 30 September 1999. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. The court made reference to the measures already taken in the investigation and indicated, in detail, the evidence that still had to be taken. Consequently, it decided that it was necessary to extend the applicant’s detention. The court als	[2]	2	1	0

These orders cited the gravity of the charges, the possibility of the applicant’s absconding and the complexity of the criminal case as the main reasons for the continued detention. From 23 July to 10 September 2004 the applicant was placed in remand prison IZ-77/1 in Moscow. He claimed that the facility had been overcrowded and that the cells had been i	[]	1	1	0

1016	The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Skopje. On 5 May 1991 the then Municipal Court of Struga (“the first-instance court”) ruled partly in the applicant's favour ordering the defendant, Mr J.T., to pay him compensation. On 29 December 1992 the then District Court of Bitola overturned the decision and increased the amount of the award. On 1 February 1993 the applicant sought enforcement before the first-instance court by an inventory and public sale of the defendant's (“the debtor”) movable property. According to the applicant, his request for enforcement was granted on 3 February 1993, but no formal decision has been ever served on him. Between 17 April 1993 and 18 April 1994 respectively, the applicant complained to the President of the first-instance court and to the State Judicial Council about the court's inactivity. No answer was provided. On 23 June 1994 an expert determined the amount of the applicant's claim with interest. 	[3]	3	1	0
1017	 The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Sîngerei. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was convicted of theft and robbery and served his sentence, having been conditionally released on 7 April 1999. On 20 April 2000 he was arrested by the police for resisting them and taken to the police station in Ialoveni. A court found that the applicant had not committed any offence and ordered his release. After releasing him, the police immediately re-arrested him and filmed him. Thereafter he was accused of having murdered P., the director of a private company. According to the prosecution, the applicant had good relations and was in frequent contact with his former colleague S., who in turn maintained close relations with a company directly competing with that of P. for rice imports from Romania. P. had received a number of threats to make him stop his activity, the latest of which had been on	[3]	2	1	0
1018	 The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Šoštanj. On 9 September 1994 the applicant was injured in a car accident. The perpetrator of the accident had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT. On 16 December 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje Local Court (Okrajno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 1,104,192 tolars (approximately 4,600 euros) for the injuries sustained.

1019	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Khabarovsk. In 2001 the applicant, a salesman by occupation, decided to go to China to purchase merchandise. On 30 July 2001 the applicant arrived at the Khabarovsk International Seaport. The customs found on him 72,300 United States dollars (USD) and 760 Chinese yuan (CNY) in cash which he had not reported in his customs declaration. The applicant was charged with attempted smuggling of foreign currency, a criminal offence under Articles 30 § 3 and 188 § 1 of the Criminal Code. The money was appended to the criminal case as physical evidence (вещественные доказательства). On 6 November 2001 the Tsentralniy District Court of Khabarovsk found the applicant guilty as charged and imposed a suspended sentence of two years’ imprisonment conditional on one year’s probation. As regards the money, the court held that: “Physical evidence – USD 72,300 and CNY 760 taken from Mr Sun Huan Xin – shall be confiscated by the St	[9]	2	1	0
1020	 The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Radom. The applicant was arrested on 24 August 1994 on suspicion of extorting protection money from an escort agency. By a decision of 26 August 1994 given by the Gdańsk Regional Prosecutor the applicant and other suspects were detained on remand. On 2 September 1994 the applicant’s lawyer appealed against the decision of 26 August 1994. His appeal was dismissed by a court on 8 September 1994. On 24 October 1994 the Gdańsk Regional Prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s lawyer’s appeal of 19 October 1994 against the detention decision, considering that a number of witnesses had given evidence incriminating all the suspects. On 24 October 1994 the Gdańsk Regional Prosecutor ordered the applicant to undergo psychiatric observation. On 10 November 1994 the Gdańsk Regional Court prolonged the applicant’s detention on remand until 21 January 1995, considering that the charges against the applicant were of a serious n	[]	2	1	0
1021	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Vorkuta, in the Republic of Komi. On 30 October 1996 police apprehended the applicant on suspicion of having committed theft from a garage, together with Sh. Upon arrival at the police station the applicant and Sh. admitted the charges. The applicant told the police the location of the garage they had robbed. It appears from the records of the applicant’s arrest and first questioning that his right to have legal assistance provided by the state or of his own choosing was explained to him. However, he declined the offer initially and said that he would appoint a counsel to defend him during the trial. On 1 November 1996 the applicant was remanded in custody. On 28 February 1997 the prosecution authorities referred the criminal case to the Vorkuta Town Court of the Republic of Komi (“the Town Court”) for trial. On 9 December 1997 the Town Court found that during the pre-trial investigation the applicant h	[3]	1	1	0

On 8 December 2007 the Żary District Court ordered his detention on remand. On 22 December 2007 he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He was discharged from the hospital on 2 January 2008. On 9 April 2008 the Żary District Court gave a decision and discontinued the proceedings against the applicant. The court found it established that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. However, he could not have been held criminally responsible as he had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. It further referred to the experts' opinion and ordered that the applicant be placed in a psychiatric hospital. On the same date the court also refused the applicant's motion for release.

In May 2004 he sued his command for its failure to grant his early discharge from service with the provision of a flat as guaranteed by domestic law. On 11 October 2004 the Moscow Garrison Court ordered the applicant’s command to provide his family with a flat in Moscow and, once the flat had been provided, to grant the applicant an early discharge. On appeal, on 14 January 2005 the Military Court of the Moscow Command modified the award. It ordered that the flat did not necessarily have to be in Moscow, that the flat should have been provided out of turn, and that the defendant was to pay 5,000 Russian roubles (RUB) by way of non-pecuniary damages. This judgment became binding on the day of its adoption but was not enforced immediately. For this reason, from January 2005 the applicant rented private flats.

It also stated that the attachment of the Company's property was impeded by the Law of 2001 “on the Introduction of a Moratorium on the Forced Sale of Property.” The judgment of 30 October 1998 was 	[3, 9]	2	1	0
1026	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lived in Split. He was the owner of a flat in Split with a surface area of 66.76 square metres. On 17 October 1955 a certain Ms P.A. was, on the basis of the Decree on Administration of Residential Buildings of 1953 (see paragraph 24 below), awarded the right to live in the flat and moved in together with her mother and her cousin I.T. (born in 1948) whom her parents had entrusted to P.A.’s care in 1951. This right was by the entry into force of the Housing Act of 1959 transformed into the specially protected tenancy (stanarsko pravo, see paragraphs 24-30 below about the specially protected tenancy in the former Yugoslavia). P.A. and I.T. lived together in the applicant’s flat until P.A. moved out in 1973. I.T. continued to live there with her husband and her son, Ig.T. (born in 1972). I.T.’s husband died in 1998.

On 28 November 2003 the Moscow City Court (“the appeal court”) upheld the above judgment on appeal. On 4 November 2000 the applicant instituted another set of proceedings against two private companies for breach of his patent rights. The first hearing was scheduled by the District Court for 4 April 2001. However, the first hearing and the next four hearings did not take place because the judge was involved in different proceedings or was on vacation, or due to the respondents’ failure to appear. In the meantime the court sent inquiries to various State agencies for information about the respondents’ place of registration. At the hearing of 13 Dec	[3]	3	1	0
1028	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Maribor. In January 1991, after two concluded disciplinary proceedings, the applicant’s employer L. dismissed the applicant from his work. The applicant, who was consequently unemployed, instituted several proceedings challenging both decisions given in the disciplinary proceedings. On 16 April 1990 and, according to the applicant, on 1 February 1991 respectively, the applicant instituted proceedings in the Ljubljana Court of Associated Labour (Sodišče združenega dela v Ljubljani) seeking the annulment of the disciplinary decisions. On 15 May 1991, after several hearings, the court delivered, in the joint proceedings, a decision rejecting the applicant’s claims. On 20 February 1992 the Court of Associated Labour of the Republic of Slovenia (Sodišče združenega dela Republike Slovenije) allowed the applicant’s appeal of 28 June 1991 and remitted the case to the first-instance court for re-examination.

1029	 The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Zabrze, Poland. On 8 January 1994 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed burglary. On 10 January 1994 he was brought before J.K., a district prosecutor from the Pszczyna District Prosecutor’s Office (Prokuratora Rejonowa), charged with six counts of burglary and detained on remand. The prosecutor considered that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question because he had been arrested in flagrante delicto. He also relied on the serious nature of the offences in question. On 12 February 1994 the Pszczyna District Prosecutor prolonged the applicant’s detention until 8 March 1994 on the ground that it was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The prosecutor stressed that in the light of evidence gathered during the investigation it was likely that the applicant had also committed other, similar offences and that, in turn, 	[2, 3]	2	1	0

On 18 August 1995 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of unlawful possession of weapons.  He was arrested on the following day. It appears that the applicant immediately obtained legal representation and also appointed Ms B. to act as his public defender. The Taldomskiy District Prosecutor’s office additionally charged the applicant with aggravated robbery and extortion. On 13 September 1995 the Taldomskiy District Prosecutor, relying on the gravity of the charges against the applicant and his liability to reoffend, authorised his placement in custody. His detention was extended a number of times, having regard to the gravity of the charges. On 29 December 1995 the Sergiyevo-Pasad Town Court of the Moscow Region authorised the applicant’s release on a written undertaking not to leave the town. Two months later the Dmi	[2, 3]	2	1	0
1031	 The applicant was born in 1983. His address is unknown. The applicant and his wife came to Austria in August 2008 and applied for asylum on 19 August 2008. They had travelled from Afghanistan via Iran to Greece. When the applicant and his wife first arrived in Greece they lived in a camp. They subsequently lived with people traffickers for approximately three months, and then in public parks. The applicant claimed that he had queued to apply for asylum in Greece, but had been beaten by the police and driven away. He and his wife had no access to financial support and had had to live in the parks after their money had run out. After four failed attempts, the traffickers managed to take the applicant and his wife to Austria. In his request for asylum in Austria the applicant claimed in substance to have had problems with the Taliban in Afghanistan. He submitted inter alia that eight years earlier the Taliban had kidnapped two of his brothers. On 14 October 	[]	1	1	1

The applicant was married to I.R. and the couple had two children, C.I., born on 19 December 1992, and Th.N., born on 12 August 1996. Following divorce and child custody proceedings initiated by I.R. on 21 March 2001, the Bucharest First District Court of First Instance held on 9 October 2001 that the children should live with their mother. The applicant was entitled to visit his children according to the following schedule: every first and third weekend of the month, from 6 p.m. on Friday to 6 p.m. on Sunday; two weeks during the summer holidays; and one week during the winter holidays. During the proceedings, two environment studies were conducted at the applicant’s home and at I.R.’s home respectively.

On 26 February 1996 the Regional Prosecutor remanded the applicant in custody on suspicion of drug trafficking, committed from August until November 1995 in conspiracy with other persons. In the detention order the prosecuting authorities stressed that the testimony given during the investigations by the co-suspects strongly supported the suspicion against the applicant. On 15 March 1996 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) dismissed the applicant's appeal against the detention order. On 25 March 1996 and on an unknown later date the applicant's requests for release were refused by the Wrocław Regional Prosecutor. On 29 March 1996 the Regional Prosecutor prolonged the applicant's detention until 30 June 1996, invoking the complexity of the case.

The applicant was the owner and the sole shareholder of Vefa Holding sh.p.k., a company initially founded as a trading company on 28 August 1992 (“the company”). Further to the expansion of its scope of activity, the company changed its registered names three times, to be finally registered on 3 February 1997 as “Vefa Holding sh.p.k.” Its expansion need and a shortage of lending opportunities from the commercial banks in the country led the applicant and his company to take loans from individuals, beginning on an unspecified date in 1994. The loan agreements were concluded under Article 1050 of the Civil Code. The process of taking loans continued until 1997 and was rolled out across the country. During this time, the authorities had not sought to intervene in order to control or stop the process. Furthermore, the company complied with the payment of taxes and levies to the competent tax authorities. In 1	[]	2	1	1

It opened with a verse mocking Jewish last names, which the applicant had overheard “at a meeting of the Russian National Unity [movement] ... organised... by a local neofascist Mr Terentyev”. The applicant wrote that at the meeting the verse had been recited by a woman in the traditional Cossack clothing. He had not approached her then, but later his curiosity was piqued when he saw that verse printed in Mr Terentyev's newspaper Kolokol and he decided to meet that woman. The applicant then related his discussion with the woman who was aggrieved by her precarious living conditions resulting from profound social and economic changes in Russia, and blamed the worsening of her situation on Jews. She confessed to being an avid reade	[6]	2	1	0

In a writ served on the tenant on 25 February 1993 the applicant informed the tenant of his intention to terminate the lease on 31 December 1993 and summoned her to appear before the Turuin Magistrate. The tenant refused to leave the premises. In a writ served on the tenant on 7 May 1993, the appliquant reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Turin Magistrate. By a decision of 19 May 1993, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Turin Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1994. On 27 January 1995 the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises.

Their faith, which is influenced, in particular, by Sufism and certain pre-Islamic beliefs, is regarded by some Alevi scholars as a separate religion and by others as the “essence” or “original form” of Islam. Its religious practices differ from those of the Sunni[1] schools of law in certain aspects such as prayer, fasting and pilgrimage (see Hasan and Eylem Zengin v. Turkey, no. 1448/04, § 8, 9 October 2007). The applicant stated that his identity card, issued by the registrar of births, marriages and deaths, contained a “religion” box which indicated “Islam”, even though he was not a follower of that religion. On 7 May 2004 he applied to the İzmir District Court seeking to have his identity card feature the word “Alevi” rather than the word “Islam”.

At the station the applicant became agitated, verbally abusing police officers, grabbing them by the clothing and hitting them. He was then handcuffed. As the applicant initially refused to give his name, police officers searched his clothing and found an identity card showing him to be a member of the Murmansk Duma. The applicant confirmed that he was a member of the regional legislature. His handcuffs were removed. The chief of the police station, who was away from the station at the time, phoned the duty officer and instructed him to invite the applicant to take an alcohol test and, should he refuse, to prepare a report on his refusal and	[4]	2	1	0
1046	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Kharkiv. In August 2003 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Moskovskyy District Court of Kharkiv against the State-owned company Kharkivskyi Elektromekhanichnyi Zavod, seeking compensation for loss of a part of his salary due to its delayed payment, and compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the respondent’s failure to pay his salary in due time. On 3 November 2003 the court awarded the applicant 634.03 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH)[1] in compensation for loss of a part of his salary due to the delay in its payment. On 25 December 2003 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal partially modified that judgment and awarded the applicant an additional UAH 1,072.62[2] in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On the same date the judgment became enforceable. In January 2004 the applicant and the respondent company appealed in cassation. In December 2004 the applicant requested t	[3]	1	1	0
1047	 The applicant was born in 1952. He is currently detained in Czerwony Bór Prison. On 12 January 2005 the applicant was arrested in Poland and charged with trafficking large amounts of drugs from Venezuela. On 14 January 2005 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody. The decision was upheld on 18 April 2005 by the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy). In its decision to detain the applicant, the District Court relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the aforementioned offence. It attached particular importance to the likelihood that a severe sentence of imprisonment would be imposed on the applicant and to the risk that he would attempt to obstruct the proceedings. The applicant’s pre-trial detention was subsequently extended by decisions of the Gdańsk Regional Court given on 22 March 2005 (upheld by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) on 27 April 2005), on 23 June 2005, on 15 September 2005	[2, 4]	2	1	0
1048	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Athens. He is a businessman, who married M.A. on 20 September 2003. At the time of their marriage M.A. was already a member of the Greek parliament (MP). On 24 March 2004 their son was born. At the end of 2004 the applicant's marriage broke down. It was pronounced dissolved by mutual consent by the Athens Court of First Instance on 7 July 2005. The applicant and M.A. concluded an agreement on 14 December 2004 resolving issues of custody and access in relation to their son. These arrangements were endorsed by a formal decision of the Athens Court of First Instance of 20 January 2005 (decision no. 528/2005). In particular, M.A. was to have custody of the child until he came of age, and he was to live with her. The applicant was entitled to open access to his son, subject to the child's needs, and certain minimum periods and days of contact were specified. In fact, he was entitled to see his son every day between 5 p.m. and	[3]	2	1	1
1049	 On 27 April 1995, the applicant was arrested and charged on two counts with conspiracy to supply Class A and Class B drugs respectively. On 27 January 1997, he and his co-defendants (Kevin Douglas, Paul Anthony Easingwood, Keith Gleeson and Andrew David Dalton) pleaded guilty to the charges after the trial judge ruled disputed evidence admissible. The evidence at issue resulted from a covert surveillance operation involving observation and recording of conversations in the home of Kevin Douglas allegedly from October 1994 until January 1995 and in April 1995. According to the applicant, the authority for such surveillance had been sought and granted on the purported grounds that the drug operation conducted by the defendants was of such sophistication that conventional evidence gathering techniques were fruitless. He claimed that it was not the Chief Constable who authorised the warrant, but rather the Chief Superintendent. The defendants challenged the admissibi	[4]	0	1	1
1050	 The applicant is the owner of an apartment in Rome, which he had let to M.D.M. In a registered letter of 8 February 1991, the applicant informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1991 and asked her to vacate the premises by that date. The tenant told the applicant that she would not leave the premises. In a writ served on the tenant on 15 January 1993, the applicant reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Rome Magistrate. By a decision of 29 April 1993, which was made enforceable on 12 May 1993, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 29 April 1994. On 18 May 1994, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises. On 11 July 1994, he served notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a	[3]	0	1	1
1051	 The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Kyiv. In December 1998 the applicant brought proceedings against Mr S. (her neighbour), alleging that he had unlawfully seized and re-designed a corridor (measuring approximately 4 square meters) in their shared house. On 28 December 1998 the Podilskyy District Court of Kyiv (hereafter “the District Court”) allowed the applicant's claim. She was awarded the ownership of the disputed corridor and Mr S. was ordered to restore its original design. On 17 May 1999 the District Court, at the applicant's request, quashed its decision of 28 December 1998 due to new circumstances (namely, that the shared house had historical value) and reopened the proceedings. On 19 August 1999 the District Court allowed the applicant's claim, declared the corridor in question to be the applicant's property and ordered Mr S. to remove the unauthorised changes in the corridor's design. No appeal was lodged against the judgment a	[3, 9]	3	1	0
1052	 The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Žalec. On 9 April 1993 the applicant was seriously injured in a car accident and, as a result, remained permanently disabled. He had previously taken out accident insurance with the insurance company ZT. On 12 October 1995 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking payment of disability allowance in the amount of 1,656,732 Slovenian tolars (approximately 6,900 euros) due to the injuries sustained in the accident. On the basis of, inter alia, the expert opinion and partly paid compensation, the applicant three times modified his claim during the proceedings. Between 24 May 1996 and 21 May 2001 the applicant lodged six preliminary written submissions and adduced evidence. Of the three hearings held between 3 September 1996 and 30 May 2001, none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. During the proceedings the court appointed a medical expert. 	[3]	2	1	0
1053	 On 22 November 1995 the Wrocław-Stare Miasto District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) charged the applicant with fraud committed together with several accomplices and detained him on remand for three months in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question and the risk that he might obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. On an unknown later date the applicant appealed to the Wrocław-Śródmieście District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) against the order for his detention. On 27 November 1995 he lodged a pleading supplementing his appeal. In that pleading, he submitted that his detention had been imposed by a prosecutor, a party to the proceedings, whereas under the Convention detention had to be ordered either by a judge or by another officer exercising judicial power. On 5 December 1995 a single judge, sitting as the Wrocław-Śródmieście District Court, dismissed the appeal, finding that the applicant's detention had an adequate legal 	[2, 4]	0	1	0
1054	 The applicant was born in 1979 and is currently detained in Łódź Remand Centre. On 25 September 2006 the Łódź District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered the applicant’s detention on remand for a period of three months. He was charged with a number of offences committed with an armed organised criminal group. In its decision, the District Court relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question. The court further emphasised the gravity of the offences in question, the applicant’s active role in the criminal group and the likelihood of a heavy prison sentence being imposed on him after conviction. In the domestic court’s view the fact that the applicant was at the time detained pending other criminal proceedings against him did not guarantee the proper course of the proceedings since the applicant could had been released at any time from the pre-trial detention without the relevant authorities, responsible for the impugned proceedi	[3]	2	1	0
1055	 The applicant was born in 1947 and lived in Ryazan. On 29 September 2008 the applicant died. On 3 August 2009 Mr Yaroslav Voblikov, the late applicant’s son (born on 19 August 1977), expressed his wish to pursue the proceedings before the Court. On 6 April 1999 the applicant brought a claim against the regional social security service for pension arrears. On 25 December 2000 the Bilibino District Court of the Chukotka Region granted the applicant’s claim in part. The applicant appealed. On 15 February 2001 the Chukotka Regional Court quashed the judgment of 25 December 2000 on appeal and remitted the matter to the District Court for fresh consideration. On 28 April 2001 the District Court partly granted the applicant’s claims. On 4 October 2001 the Regional Court upheld the judgment of 28 April 2001 on appeal. On 25 October 2001 the applicant obtained a writ of execution. Subsequently the judgment was enforced. On 17 September 2002 the 	[3]	2	1	0

On 2 November 2005 an investigating judge of the Bitola Court of First Instance (“the trial court”) heard, in the presence of the public prosecutor alone, oral evidence from E.J and R.M., suspected migrants from Albania (“the migrants”), who had attempted to enter Greece illegally from the territory of the respondent State. Both of them waived the right to an interpreter and gave evidence in Macedonian. According to the court record, they gave details as regards their travel from Albania to Bitola, a city located near the border with Greece. Both confirmed that at Bitola bus station, they had asked a taxi driver to take them to Greece, but the latter had refused because they had no travel documents. E.J. further stated: “... My friend R.

On the following day the Słupsk District Court remanded him in custody until 15 May 2000 on suspicion of homicide and attempted burglary. It relied on the evidence given by the applicant’s co-suspect. In addition, the court held that his detention was justified in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings and referred to the severity of the anticipated penalty. Furthermore, having regard to the fact that the applicant had not confessed, the court considered that there was a reasonable risk that he would attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimonies or otherwise interfere with the proceedings. On 11 May 2000 the District Court prolonged the applicant’s detention until 15 July 2000. It referred to the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences in question and the severity of the anticipated penalty. The court further held that t	[2]	1	1	0

He receives a disability pension on account of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). He is active as an instructor in ice hockey and football. In July 2001, the applicant's wife moved out of their home and went to live in Finland. The children have since lived with the applicant. Shortly after her departure, Mrs J.V. sought to obtain an interlocutory injunction granting her the sole responsibility for the daily care of the children, arguing that the applicant had physically abused her and had an abusive consumption of medication. The applicant has been taking medication for ADHD and for an earlier back injury. Both the Stavanger City Court (byrett) and Gulating High Court (lagmannsrett) rejected her request. Subsequently the applicant and Mrs J.V. concluded a judicial settlement agreement accor	[]	2	1	1
1059	 The applicant inherited a piece of land along with three other persons in Seydişehir. He holds a title deed to the land as a joint owner. In 1976 the authorities conducted a land registry survey in Seydişehir and revised the local plans. Following this revision, the land in question was registered in the Land Registry with the title of six other persons (Zehra Özden and five others: 'the defendants') along with the applicant's and the three other persons' title ('the plaintiffs') as the heirs of Mr Kara Beşe Ahmet Bin-i Ali Efendi (A.E.). On 3 August 1977 the applicant and the three other plaintiffs brought an action in the Seydişehir Civil Court of General Jurisdiction (Asliye Hukuk Mahkemesi) against Zehra Özden and five defendants. The applicant and his co-plaintiffs stated that the land in question had belonged to their and the defendants' testator (muris), A.E.

1060	 The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Budapest. On 28 December 1987 the applicant brought an action against his ex-wife, seeking the division of their matrimonial property. In the period between 29 March 1988 and 19 May 1992, ten hearings took place and the opinions of valuation experts were obtained. Further hearings took place on 19 September, 28 October and 16 December 1994, 2 February and 23 March 1995. Meanwhile, the expert was invited to submit a new opinion and to complete it subsequently. On 20 June 1995 the Buda Central District Court ordered the applicant to pay 675,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) to his ex-wife. On appeal, the Budapest Regional Court, on 8 March 1996, quashed parts of the appealed judgment and remitted those parts to the District Court. Furthermore, it fixed the parties’ respective shares of the property. On 27 May 1997, on the applicant’s petition for review, the Supreme Court quashed the second-i	[3]	2	1	0
1061	 The applicant was born in 1976. On 29 December 2009 a police investigator initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and charged him with fraudulent appropriation of property.

On 29 April 2010 the applicant’s pre-trial detention was ordered by a court. On 25 June 2010 the applicant was released under a written undertaking not to abscond. In February 2011 the case was referred to the Dzerzhynskyy District Court of Kharkiv (“the District Court”) for trial. On 4 April 2011 the District Court held a preliminary hearing in the case.

1062	 The applicant was born in 1946. On 6 December 1995 L.T. who had been wounded by a gunshot, requested that a criminal investigation be instituted. Consequently, an investigation in rem was instituted. On 17 January 1996 the applicant was arrested in connection with the investigation. On 18 January 1996 the Łódź Regional Prosecutor imposed pre-trial detention on him and three other suspects on charges of acting in an organised criminal gang and aggravated assault. The prosecutor considered that the evidence had justified the charges against the applicant, who was also suspected of being a leader of the criminal gang. It was further noted that other members of the gang had not yet been arrested. There was therefore a serious risk of collusion and suppression of evidence. Furthermore, there were grounds for believing that the applicant had ordered someone to murder L.T. The applicant appealed. On 22 January 1996 the prosecutor served the applicant with a written state	[2]	2	1	0

On 4 August 2000 at about 10 p.m. A.Č. was found in the living quarters of Block 5 of the prison, showing signs of having been beaten. As noted in the transcript of a recorded conversation between A.Č. and the guard on duty, A.Č. refused to make a written statement explaining the circumstances of the incident, even though asked to do so by the guards. He also refused to be checked by a doctor, although the guards pointed out that A.Č. had injuries on his face and that he should see one. To prevent A.Č. from possibly being beaten up again, the prison guards locked him in solitary confinement (Baudos izoliatorius) until the morning.

1066	 The applicant was born in 1929 and lived in Budakalász. He had a joint title to a plot of land in the value of 4.59 “gold crowns” (aranykorona). The land was, from an unspecified date on, in the possession of, and used by, a Socialist “collective farm”. Following the adoption of Act no. II of 1993 on Land Settlement and Land Distribution Committees, the Pest County Land Registry adopted a plan on the division of such properties. That decision was subsequently upheld by the Bács-Kiskun and Pest County Office of Compensation. On 15 November 1999 a plot of arable land of 979 square metres, situated in the village of Budakalász, was designated by the Pest County Land Registry for the purpose of privatisation, under lot no. 3305.

In early 2002 the national authorities received information to suggest that the applicant and another person were involved in drug trafficking, in particular the supply of large quantities of heroin. The authorities decided to carry out various investigative measures in respect of them under the Operational-Search Activities Act, including a test purchase of drugs and a video recording of the operation. On 12 April 2002 the applicant was arrested after having handed over parcels containing drugs to undercover officers K. and G. The preparation and carrying out of the operation were witnessed by Ko. and D., who had been asked by the authorities to take part in the operation as “members of the public”.

On 14 April 2003 the Governorship of Tunceli informed the applicant that he could move back to his village and that he would receive services and financial support from the Governorship for doing so. Subsequently, on 18 June 2003 the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement (Bayındırlık ve İskan Bakanlığı) conducted an on-site inspection and issued a report which indicated that the houses in the village were old and ruined.

On 21 February 2003 the applicant, at the material time Vice-President of the Workers’ Party (Munkáspárt) – a registered left-wing political party – was a speaker at a lawful demonstration in the centre of Budapest. The demonstration took place at the former location of a statue of Karl Marx, which had been removed by the authorities. On his jacket, the applicant wore a five-pointed red star (hereinafter “the red star”), 5 cm in diameter, as a symbol of the international workers’ movement. In application of Article 269/B § 1 of the Criminal Code, a police patrol which was present called on the applicant to remove the star, which he did.

The judgment became final and the writ of execution was transferred to the Bailiffs' Service for enforcement. However, it was not enforced due to lack of funds on the debtor's current account. On 26 December 2001 the Odessa Regional Commercial Court, upon the applicant's request, ordered the enforcement of the judgment of 24 June 1998 by attaching the debtor's property. On 14 November 2002 the writ of execution was returned to the applicant as the enforcement proceedings 	[3]	3	1	0

While he was in judicial separation proceedings from his wife (D.L.), a provisional residence order was issued to both parents in respect of the couple’s two children (G.L. and M.T.). On 29 August 2007 the applicant asked the guardianship judge to issue him with a new passport, requesting that the name of his son, G.L., also be entered in it. His former wife objected, arguing that the applicant was not making the maintenance payments ordered by the president of the court at the time of the judicial separation. By a decree of 18 September 2007, the guardianship judge rejected the applicant’s request, holding that it was inappropriate to issue the requested passport, given the imperative of protecting the children’s right to receive the maintenance payments. In this regard, he emphasised that the applicant, who was supposed to make a maintenance payment of 600 euros (EUR) per month, paid only a small amoun	[]	2	1	1

On 30 November 2004, pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by the Maltese authorities on 23 November 2004, the applicant was arrested and detained in Spain on suspicion of having conspired in the traffic of cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis. On 3 May 2005 the applicant, through his legal counsel, challenged the lawfulness of his arrest and detention in so far as the arrest warrant had not been issued in accordance with the European Arrest Warrant requirements (in force on 7 June 2004). In a judgment of 16 August 2005, the Constitutional Court of Malta rejected the applicant’s claim as the extradition request had been made prior to the new arrest warrant procedure with the result that the previous law applied. On 9 September 2005 the applicant was extradited to Malta to stand trial on charges of drug trafficking. On 10 September 2005 the applicant was brought	[]	2	1	1

In August 2007 the applicant brought proceedings seeking compensation for his allegedly unlawful detention during the criminal proceedings against him which had been discontinued as time-barred in 2002 (see paragraph 6 above). His claim was dismissed by two levels of court in 2008. Referring to section 8 of interpretative decision No. 3 of 22 April 2004 of the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 43 below), the second-instance court held that State responsibility for damage could not be engaged as measures and steps taken before the expiration of the statute of limitations cannot be considered unlawful	[1, 4]	2	1	0

Новочеркасска – “the Commissariat”) seeking to recover his pension arrears from January 1995 to March 1998 to take account of the increase of the minimum monthly wage. On 15 September 2004 the Novocherkassk Town Court of the Rostov Region granted the applicant’s claim and awarded him 261,343.87 roubles (RUB) in arrears. On the applicant’s request the court held that the judgment should be enforced immediately since it concerned the applicant’s main source of income and was of considerable importance for the applicant’s financial situation. The Commissariat did not appeal against the judgment and on 25 September 2004 it became final. On 12 October 2004 the applicant’s representative submitted the copy of	[3, 9]	3	1	0

On 15 November 1996 the applicant brought before the Poznań – Stare Miasto District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) an action for the division of the estate of his late father. The estate comprised, inter alia, real property located in Poznań. Shortly afterwards, the applicant asked the same court for a decision declaring that he had acquired his late father's estate. On an unspecified subsequent date both actions were consolidated into one. On 16 July 1998 the case was referred to the Stargard Szczeciński District Court as most of the parties to the proceedings lived in that region. On 21 September 1999 the court gave a partial decision (postanowienie częściowe) declaring that the applicant had acquired 3/16 of the estate. On 11 May 2004 the Szczecin Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) referred the case in its part concerning the division of an inheritance to the Poznań District Court. It further deci	[3]	2	1	0

In a registered letter of 20 January 1992, the applicant informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1993 and asked her to vacate the premises by that date. In a writ served on the tenant on 20 April 1993, the applicant reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Florence Magistrate. By a decision of 12 July 1993, which was made enforceable on 4 August 1993, the Florence Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1993. On 10 March 1995, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises. On 27 March 1995, he informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 30 May 1995. </	[4]	3	1	1
1090	 The applicant, Mr Krzysztof Orchowski, is a Polish national who was born in 1971 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Wrocław Remand Centre in Poland. By the time the instant case was communicated to the Polish Government, the applicant had been detained subsequently in four detention facilities (see paragraphs 8 – 45 below). On 26 April 2007, however, he was transferred to Kamińsk Prison and from there, on 3 July 2007, to Gdańsk Remand Centre. Subsequently, on 13 February 2008 the applicant was taken to Goleniów Prison.

The applicant on several occasions unsuccessfully applied to be released and to have the preventive measure imposed on him changed into a more lenient one. The courts justified their decisions prolonging the applicant’s detention on remand and their refusals to release him by the existence of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence concerned and by the severity of the anticipated sentence. On 22 March 2002 the Słupsk Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentence	[2, 4]	2	1	0

The amount of the debt was linked to the exchange rate of the United States dollar. Mr M. failed to repay the full amount in due time, and on 19 April 2001 the applicant brought a civil action against him. The applicant sought to recover 141,800 Russian roubles (RUB) on account of the outstanding debt, plus statutory interest for the period of delay (проценты за неисполнение денежного обязательства). The amount of statutory interest was calculated on the basis of the refinancing rate of the Central Bank of Russia. In the domestic proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer. Mr M., the defendant, claimed that he had returned RUB 45,000 to the applicant. However, he acknowledged the remainder of the principal debt, and accepted the calculations of statutory interest.

On 22 March 2000 the Oława District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided to detain the applicant on remand. It considered that the applicant's detention was justified by the existence of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence and the gravity of the charges. It also relied on the risk that the applicant might induce witnesses to give false testimony or obstruct the proceedings against him by other means. On 20 April 2000 the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed the applicant's appeal against that decision. On 21 June 2000 the Regional Court prolonged the applicant's detention until 21 September 2000.

On 8 December 2003 the Vake-Saburtalo District Court in Tbilisi remanded the applicant in custody for three months. The court endorsed the prosecutor’s argument that, in view of the applicant’s prior conviction for which he had been on probation, there was a reasonable suspicion that he might abscond pending the new set of proceedings. On 19 February 2004 the prosecution brought against the applicant and two other persons additional charges of conspiracy to commit the unlawful possession of arms, robbery and murder.

In November 1996 P.V. and P.O. instituted civil proceedings in the Kyivsky District Court of Kharkiv (“the District Court”) against S.N., seeking to declare that the latter was no longer entitled to live in the apartment in question. S.N., in turn, lodged a counterclaim, seeking to have his property right over the disputed apartment acknowledged. On 18 March 1997 the court allowed the claim of P.V. and P.O. In March 1998, following privatisation procedures, a “property certificate” (приватизаційний сертифікат) was issued to P.V. and P.O. for the apartment.

On 6 March 2009, following two remittals of the case to the first-instance court for fresh examination, the proceedings were completed by a final ruling of the Supreme Court rejecting the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation. As a result, the applicant’s claim was allowed in part. In early April 2009 the above ruling was served on the applicant. According to the Government, the proceedings were delayed for a year and three months due to financial expert examinations 	[3]	2	1	0

1149	 The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Kumanovo. On 4 August 1995 the Kumanovo Employment Bureau (“the Bureau”) (Републичкиот завод за вработување - Биро за вработување Куманово) granted the applicant, who had been laid off, a monthly unemployment compensation, the amount of which equalled the minimum salary reduced by 20%. 6  On 28 August 1995 the applicant appealed the decision before the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy (“the Ministry”) (Министерство за труд и социјална политика), alleging that his compensation had been miscalculated. He claimed that the amount of compensation should be based on the average of his last three monthly salaries reduced by 50%.

On 7 July 2004 the Kielce District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody. It relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and on the risk that he might tamper with evidence. Further, the court referred to the severity of the anticipated sentence. The applicant appealed against the detention order. On 10 August 2004 the Kielce Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) upheld the first‑instance decision.

On 23 December 2003 the Warsaw District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. The court indicated that the evidence gathered in the case, in particular the witnesses’ testimonies, showed that there was a strong probability that the applicant had committed the crimes he was suspected of. It attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. It further considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence, induce witnesses to give false testimony or go into hiding.

At about noon on 18 November 2002 the applicant was arrested when walking down a street. According to the applicant, he was seized by force by two policemen dressed in civilian clothes, without any explanations. According to the police officers, they invited him for questioning concerning P.'s robbery and he swore at them and attempted to escape, making it necessary to arrest him by force.

On 24 May 1994 the Feldkirch District Authority (Bezirkshaupt-mannschaft) dismissed this request, finding that there was no adequate access to the applicant's plot of land. On 9 June 1994 the applicant filed an appeal against this decision. On 29 September 1994 the Weiler Municipality issued a building prohibition for the area within which the applicant's plot of land was situated, as it was planning to open re-allocation proceedings (Umlegungs-verfahren) to ensure a more efficient use of the area.

The applicant signed the arrest record, noting that he had been informed of his constitutional rights as an accused, including the right to remain silent and to be assisted by counsel. He also made a handwritten statement refusing legal assistance “at the time of the arrest”.

1172	 The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Landas. In July 1964 the applicant was prosecuted for the abduction and murder of Luc Taron, an 11-year-old boy, on 26 and 27 May 1964. On 5 July 1964, while in police custody, the applicant signed a confession which he stood by for the first ten months of the investigation. Later that day he was placed in pre-trial detention. The investigating judge questioned him on several occasions about the reasons for his conduct, which was inconsistent with his confession, but the applicant refused to offer an explanation. On 21 December 1964 a panel of experts in neuropsychiatry submitted a report. The experts submitted that the applicant had not been suffering from mental illness at the time of the events and contended that the physiological and psychological abnormalities observed, coupled with the applicant’s alleged memory loss at the time of the killing, “[made] it impossible to rule out the presence of an epilepti	[]	3	1	1
1173	 The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Odessa. In September 1994 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Central District Court of Odessa (the “District Court”; Центральний районний суд м. Одеса)[1] against the Publishing House “Chornomorya” (the “Company”; Видавництво “Чорномор'я”), seeking his reinstatement as a typographer and various compensations in connection with his allegedly unlawful dismissal. Subsequently, the Company and Mr L., its lawyer, brought libel proceedings against the applicant, claiming to have been defamed by certain of his submissions before the court. The applicant lodged a counterclaim for libel, alleging that certain submissions were defamatory. All of these complaints were joined. On 26 April 1996 the District Court reinstated the applicant in his position, partly allowed his compensation and other claims, and dismissed all claims for libel brought by both parties.

1174	 The applicant was born in 1960 and is currently detained in the Łódź Detention Centre. On 6 October 2005 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 7 October 2005 the Łódź District Court decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed various offences related to extortions, attempted murders, kidnappings and robberies while acting in an organised criminal gang. The applicant's pre-trial detention was extended on 20 December 2005 and on 21 March, 20 June, 1 August, 20 September and 20 December 2006. The courts relied on the severity of the possible sentence, which created a risk of the applicant's going into hiding or interfering with the proper course of the proceedings, and the necessity of gathering evidence in this particularly complex case. The court relied heavily on the complexity of the proceedings which involved many co‑accused who had allegedly participated in an organised, armed gang. 	[2]	2	1	0
1175	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Rečica ob Savinji. On 6 March 1998 the applicant was injured in a car accident. The perpetrator of the accident had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT. On 2 November 1998 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 3,107,000 tolars (approximately 13,000 euros) for the injuries sustained. Between 3 September 1999 and 11 June 2003 the applicant made eight requests that a date be set for a hearing. Between 13 June 2000 and 11 June 2003 he lodged ten preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence. Of the three hearings held between 27 July 2000 and 11 September 2003 none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. During the proceedings the court appointed two medical experts. The court also sought an additional opinion from one of the appointed experts. At the last hearing the court decided to deliver 	[3]	2	1	0
1176	 The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is a former officer of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). In 1998 he participated in a much publicised press conference together with three other FSB officers. Some time after the press conference the applicant remained in the country but was dismissed from the FSB. From 1998 to 2002 he served in the tax police and he later became a practising lawyer and a member of the bar association. On an unspecified date the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office initiated an inquiry relating to the period of the applicant's service in the FSB. The inquiry concerned the alleged disclosure of certain classified material by the applicant. On 22 January 2002 the prosecution carried out a search of the applicant's home and discovered certain documents allegedly containing classified information. Assorted cartridges for various types of weapons were also 	[1, 2, 3]	0	1	0
1177	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in the town of Omsk. On 20 July 2004 the Tsentralniy District Court of Omsk accepted the applicant's action against the Omsk Town Council and ordered that the Council should provide the applicant and his family members with a well-equipped flat, taking into account that the applicant had the right to an additional room. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the Omsk Regional Court on 25 August 2004. On 16 September 2004 enforcement proceedings were instituted. On 28 December 2004 the Tsentralniy District Court clarified its judgment of 20 July 2004, noting that the Council should buy a flat at the expense of the federal budget. The judgment remains unenforced because the Federal Treasury did not provide the Council with necessary funds.	[3, 9]	2	1	0
1178	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Ashtarak, Armenia. He is the chairman of a regional branch of the Republic Party («Հանրապետություն» կուսակցություն). In 2003 a presidential election was held in Armenia with its first and second rounds taking place on 19 February and 5 March respectively. Following the first and second rounds, a series of protest rallies were organised in Yerevan by the opposition parties. On 20 February 2003 the applicant participated in a demonstration held in Yerevan which was apparently followed by a march. On 26 February 2003, when another demonstration was apparently supposed to take place in Yerevan, the applicant and two other members of his party set off by car from Ashnak village to Yerevan. The applicant alleged that on the road to Yerevan their car was stopped by several individuals in civilian clothes who introduced themselves as officers of the Aragatsotn Regional Police Department. The applicant and his c	[7]	2	1	0
1179	 The applicant was born in 1973 and is detained in Tver remand centre no. 69/1. In April 2003 he was taken into custody on suspicion of armed robbery. He was detained in Smolensk remand centre no. 67/1. It appears that the medical record indicated that the applicant had had a brain contusion earlier in the same year. At 4 p.m. on 20 June 2003 two police officers from the Rudnyanskiy district police station (Rudnya, Smolensk Region) came to the remand centre to take the applicant and his co-defendant Mr P. to the temporary detention centre of the Rudnyanskiy police station, where they were to await the court hearing scheduled for 23 June 2003. According to the register of the temporary detention centre, the applicant had no visible injuries on 20 June 2003. On arrival at the temporary detention centre officer Sh. told the applicant to go to a cell located across the corridor from the cell where Mr P. had been placed. Apparently, this was intended to prevent	[1]	2	1	0
1180	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Heidelberg. He is the father of a son born out of wedlock on 21 December 2003. Shortly after the child was born, the mother refused the applicant any contact with him. In 2004 the applicant unsuccessfully attempted to establish contact. On 19 May 2005 the applicant lodged a request with the Frankfurt/Main District Court for the regulation of contact rights. The course of proceedings before the District Court is summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kuppinger v. Germany [Committee], no. 41599/09, §§ 6-33, 21 April 2011. By interim order of 22 May 2007 the District Court ordered weekly supervised contact between the applicant and his son. Three supervised contact meetings took place between 14 June and 19 July 2007. On 21 December 2009 the District Court suspended the applicant’s contact rights for one year. This decision was amended on 22 March 2010 with respect to the applicant’s right to be informed about th	[4]	2	1	1
1181	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Chernigiv. On 29 May 1998 he lodged a claim with the Desnyanskyy District Court of Chernigiv (“the District Court”) against the Ministry of the Interior seeking damages for injuries caused to him by its employee Mr O. From 18 December 1998 to 22 July 1999 and from 23 September 1999 to 1 November 1999 the proceedings were suspended pending the outcome of criminal proceedings against Mr O. Following two remittals of the case for fresh examination, on 19 May 2004 the District Court partly allowed the applicant’s claim and awarded him certain amounts in damages. On 16 September 2004 and 30 April 2007 respectively the Chernigiv Regional Court of Appeal and the Poltava Regional Court of Appeal (the latter court acting as a court of cassation) upheld the above judgment. The decision of 30 April 2007 was served on the applicant on 14 August 2007. According to the Government, in the course of the procee	[3]	2	1	0
1182	 The applicant was born in 1962. On 21 February 2002, the Bucharest County Court convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to thirteen years’ imprisonment. The judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court of Justice, which dismissed an appeal by the applicant on 15 May 2003. The applicant started serving his sentence in Rahova Prison. On 2  December 2008 he was transferred to Jilava Prison. He remained in prison until his release on probation on 6 July 2010. The circumstances of the applicant’s transfer from Rahova Prison to Jilava Prison are in dispute between the parties. (a)  The applicant’s account On 2 December 2008, the applicant, with seventy other detainees, was transferred from Rahova Prison to Jilava Prison. The applicant was informed about his transfer only that morning and he was allowed only ten minutes to take some personal belongings. The detainees were kept in the reception area of Rahova Prison from 8.30 	[1]	2	1	0
1183	 The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Byshiv. On an unspecified date in April 1998 he lodged an action against a collective farm B., seeking damages for a discrepancy in the calculation of compensation for his professional illness that had been paid since 1982. On 9 April 1998 the Makariv District Court (“the District Court”) opened proceedings. In a judgment of 28 December 1998 it dismissed the applicant's action. On 6 April 1999 the Kyiv Regional Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) quashed that judgment and ordered a fresh hearing. On 20 April 2000 the District Court ordered an accounting expert examination. It held the next hearing on 2 June 2003. On 4 July 2003 the Makariv Department of State Insurance Fund for Industrial Accidents and Diseases (“the Fund”) joined the proceedings as a second respondent and B. was replaced by its legal successor, private company L. On 21 October 2003 the District Court dismissed the applican	[3]	3	1	0
1184	 The applicant was born in 1951 and is currently detained in Nicosia Central Prison. He is serving concurrent eighteen-year sentences pursuant to his conviction for two counts of attempted murder. On 5 September 2003 the applicant was permitted to leave detention on twenty-four hour leave granted by the prison director. He did not return to the prison when his leave expired. Following a search to trace his whereabouts, he was arrested on 21 September 2003. At the time of his arrest he was in possession of a gun and cartridges and was wearing a bullet-proof vest and a woman’s wig. He was transferred to the maximum security wing of the prison and placed in solitary confinement. He was thus confined until 7 November 2003, that is, for a total of 47 days. The parties’ submissions concerning the conditions of the applicant’s detention during the period of his solitary confinement differed. The Government agreed that the applicant had been detained in the prison	[1, 4]	2	1	1
1185	 The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Plovdiv. The applicant’s father owned one quarter of a plot of land with a total surface area of 2,184 square metres, situated in Plovdiv. In the period between 1954 and 1956 the plot was expropriated for public use. In 1956 the applicant’s father received, as compensation for the expropriation, a plot of land in the same area, which he sold in 1957 to a third person. On 8 April 1992, after the entry into force of the Law on the Restitution of Property Expropriated under Building Planning Legislation (“the 1992 Law” – see paragraph 26 below), the applicant submitted a request to the mayor of Plovdiv (“the mayor”) for the revocation of the expropriation and the restitution of the expropriated property to her as an heir of the person from whom it had been expropriated. The mayor dismissed her request, finding that the property could not be restored to the applicant as a bridge had been built over it. The 	[9]	3	1	0
1186	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Katowice. On 9 December 2002 a hearing in a criminal case concerning a large‑scale fraud and generating considerable media interest was held before the Kraków Śródmieście District Court. Advocate J.Z., representing three accused (K.W., A.D. and A.M.D.) submitted to the court a power of attorney authorising another advocate, Ms D.K. who also represented A.M.D., to replace him for the purposes of representing his other two clients. The court accepted that document without any comment. During the same hearing a heated exchange broke out between lawyers representing various defendants as to the possibility of a conflict of interest between various clients of lawyers involved in the case, including between J.Z.’s two clients K.W. and A.D. on the one hand and A.M.D., represented by advocate D.K., on the other. During that exchange advocate J.Z. declared that he would not represent A.M.D. any longer. The court expressed the vie	[]	2	1	0
1187	 On 3 June 1994 an action in defamation (üble Nachrede) was brought against the applicant. He was suspected of having abused another person in the course of an altercation. Trial hearings were held on 8 November 1994, 8 May 1995 and 3 October 1995 before the Herzogenburg District Court (Bezirksgericht). On the latter date the applicant was convicted of defamation and sentenced to a fine. On 4 March 1996, following the applicant’s appeal, the St. Pölten Regional Court quashed the sentence because of errors of procedure and law, and referred the case back to the District Court. It found, inter alia, that the District Court had relied on evidence that had been precluded. On 17 February 1997, after hearings on that date and 10 January 1997, the District Court convicted the applicant again, qualifying the incriminated behaviour this time as an insult (Beleidigung). On 8 January 1998, following the applicant’s appeal, the St. Pölten Regional Court quashed the s	[3]	0	1	1
1188	 The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Norway. In 1987 the applicant married a Polish national M.C. In 1989 M.C. gave birth to their first daughter A. Subsequently, their son B was born in 1992 and their second daughter C in 1994. The applicant and his family lived in Norway. The household also included S.C., the son of M.C. born in 1980 of her previous marriage. On 22 November 1994 M.C. was committed to a psychiatric institution for more than two months. According to the applicant she was diagnosed with “a clear paranoid psychosis”. S.C. suffered from development disorders caused by “massive rejection” by his mother. On 31 March 1998 the applicant and M.C. separated. Subsequently, they filed for divorce. On 15 June 1998 the Inderøy District Court granted the applicant the custody of A, B and C. Moreover, the court granted M.C. visiting rights. She was allowed to visit the children in their house once a week and every s	[3, 4]	2	1	0
1189	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Pazardjik. On 19 August 1993 he was arrested, charged with the rape of a minor and remanded in custody. Six other persons were also charged. According to the indictment, the victim had been abducted by a Mr. A. and had been raped numerous times by several persons, some of whom had paid to Mr A. for having sex with the victim. Mr A. was charged with rape and acting as a procurer of prostitution. According to the applicant, all accused persons and the alleged victim are of Roma origin. On unspecified dates an investigator interrogated the alleged victim and other accused persons and heard several experts. In June 1994 the applicant and six other persons were indicted and the case listed for trial. In September and October 1994 the trial court referred the case to the prosecutor in view of certain deficiencies in the investigation. On 17 February 1995 the applicant was released on bail.

1190	 The applicant was born in 1988 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Geguti no. 8 Prison. On 8 March 2006 the applicant was arrested in connection with a robbery. On 16 October 2006 the Kaspi District Court convicted him and three others of conspiracy to commit robbery. The conviction was based on various evidence, including the statements of the victim, who had identified the applicant and the other accused as the perpetrators during the trial. The applicant was sentenced to six years in prison. As disclosed by the transcript of the trial, the victim, a person of Azerbaijani origin who had difficulty in speaking Georgian, was assisted by an interpreter. The lawyers of the accused, including that of the applicant, extensively examined the victim and other witnesses for the prosecution. On 8 November 2006 the applicant appealed against the conviction of 16 October 2006, calling into question the lower court’s assessment of the evidence an	[]	1	1	0
1191	 The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Rīga. On 25 April 1998 the police arrested the applicant and another individual, V.J., both of whom were suspects of an aggravated assault against a victim, P.M. (“the victim”). They were then taken to Rīga Main police station (Rīgas Galvenā Policijas Pārvalde). On the same day the applicant was interviewed at the station and denied committing the offence. According to the applicant’s statement he was in the stairwell of a dwelling house when the victim attacked him, punching and hitting him in the left ear. After the fight the applicant ran downstairs and noticed a policeman chasing him. In order to escape he smashed through a window in the entrance door and as a result cut his wrists. The applicant was then surrounded by several police officers who brought him to the ground and one of the officers proceeded to kick him twice in the head near his left ear. When questioned on 27 April 1998, the victim alleged th	[1]	2	1	0
1192	 The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Karacabey. On 17 October 1996 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of armed robbery and murder. On 27 October 1996 he was placed in detention on remand. On 4 November 1996 the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant in the Bursa Assize Court. On 27 November 1997 the applicant was released pending trial. Subsequently, on 29 June 2001 the Bursa Assize Court acquitted the applicant of the charges against him and this judgment was upheld by the Court of Cassation on 19 March 2002. On 5 August 2002 the applicant applied to the Bursa Assize Court, seeking compensation for both non-pecuniary and pecuniary damage pursuant to Law no. 466 pertaining to the payment of compensation to persons unlawfully arrested or detained. On 23 January 2003 the Bursa Assize Court awarded the applicant 358,071,000 Turkish[1] liras (TRL) for pecuniary damage and TRL 3,000,000,000 for non-p	[3]	2	1	0
1193	 The applicant was born in 1963 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Riga. The applicant alleges that for an extended period of time in the 1990s he was a police informant on criminal matters in Balvi. It appears that that collaboration was officially documented by the police and the applicant was paid for his services. Over time, the criminal community in Balvi became aware of his role as an informant, and as a result he was assaulted and threatened with murder on several occasions. The applicant then moved to Rēzekne. On 6 October 2005 the applicant was arrested on charges of rape of his partner’s minor daughter and of indecent assault on the partner’s minor son. The applicant was transferred to Daugavpils Prison on 25 October 2005, and stayed there until 26 October 2006, when he was transferred elsewhere (see paragraph 20 below). During this period he was taken to Riga Central Prison on four occasions. He spent a total of approximately fifty-fi	[1]	2	1	0
1194	 The applicant was born in 1983 and lives in Adana. On 31 December 2000 at about 00.15 a.m. the applicant, who was seventeen years old at the time, was taken into police custody in Adana on suspicion of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation by way of chanting slogans in favour of that organisation and by burning tyres in the streets. The same day he was interrogated by the police and the public prosecutor respectively, in the absence of a lawyer. According to the information in the file, the applicant was released on the second day of custody. On 10 January 2001 the Public Prosecutor at the Adana State Security Court filed an indictment accusing the applicant and three others of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, an offence under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).

1195	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Mionica. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 7 November 2001 the applicant, a bus conductor, was dismissed by his employer, “Lasta Strela”, a transportation company based in Valjevo. On 24 December 2001 he filed a claim with the Municipal Court in Valjevo (“the Municipal Court”), seeking reinstatement and payment of salary arrears. Following a remittal of 14 April 2003, the next hearing in the case was scheduled by the Municipal Court for 27 September 2004. Of the nine separate hearings scheduled between 27 September 2004 and 26 January 2006, it would appear that four were adjourned whilst five were held. As regards the former, two hearings were adjourned because the respondent and/or several witnesses had not been duly summoned and the other two because witnesses, of whom two were proposed by the applicant, had, though duly summoned, failed to 	[3]	2	1	0
1196	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Tata. At the request of his former employer, on 7 November 2002 the Tata District Court issued a payment order in the amount of approximately 42,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) against the applicant, a lawyer. Following his objection to the order, the case continued as civil litigation. On 17 December 2002 it was transferred to the Komárom District Court, as the judges of the geographically competent Tata District Court felt biased on account of the applicant’s legal practice being attached to their court. The Komárom District Court found for the plaintiff on 19 April 2005. The applicant appealed. In the proceedings before the Komárom-Esztergom County Regional Court, a panel of three judges, including judges Dr D. and Dr K., withdrew themselves from the case on 4 July 2005. According to their reasoning: “In view of the fact that the respondent acts as a lawyer in the county, [and] we are in a work relations	[3]	2	1	0
1197	 The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Ostróda. The applicant was arrested on 26 March 2002 at 4 p.m. On the same day the Olsztyn District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody until 26 June 2002 in view of the reasonable suspicion that, together with three other suspects, he had stolen several cars. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary given the risk that he might obstruct the proceedings; the court did not, however, state its reasons for taking such a view. It also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence. The applicant’s appeal against the detention order was unsuccessful, as were his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and his applications for release. His detention was extended on several occasions by the Olsztyn District Court (decisions of 20 May and 23 August 2002, 4 and 14 February 2003 and 14 May 2003) and his appeals against extension were dismissed by the Olsztyn R	[2, 4]	1	1	0
1198	 The applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Nicosia. The applicant, a businessman, was the defendant in an action filed against him before the District Court if Nicosia on 23 January 1986 by the Federal Bank of Lebanon (civil action no. 747/86). The plaintiff bank sued the applicant in his capacity as guarantor of a Greek company, Hellas Eurotrade Ltd. The facts leading to the action had taken place between 1975 and 1977 in a number of countries, including Cyprus, Lebanon, Nigeria, France and Greece. Hellas Eurotrade Ltd had been established in 1975 and had three shareholders: the applicant who held 40% of the shares and three other individuals that held the remaining shares in equal parts. The company had been set up for the purposes of performing a contract between another company, World Tide Shipping Corporation, and the Nigerian Defence Ministry for the provision of 240,000 metric tons of cement to the latter. The Nigerian Central Bank had opened a	[3]	3	1	1
1199	 By a penal order of 8 October 1997, the applicant was fined 1,000 French francs (FRF) for an assault on his wife that did not incapacitate her from work. On 8 December 1997 he applied to the Saverne Police Court to have that order set aside. On 3 July 1998 the applicant was served by a court bailiff with a summons requiring him to attend the Police Court on 15 September 1998 to answer a charge of “intentional assault entailing no unfitness for work” on 24 July 1997. The offence was classified as a “Class 4 minor offence” and carried a maximum fine of FRF 5,000 under Article 131-13 of the Criminal Code. On 11 August 1998 the applicant lodged a legal-aid application with the legal-aid office of the Saverne tribunal de grande instance, in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Aid Act of 10 July 1991 and its implementing decree of 19 December 1991. He furnished evidence, which the legal-aid office accepted, that his monthly income was FRF 2,423. In ac	[]	0	1	1
1200	 The applicant, a member of the Civil Guard (Guardia Civil), was born in 1969 and lives in Valencia. At the material time he was stationed at the Gijón headquarters and had been on sick leave since 5 January 1998. On 16 February 1998 he was informed that one of his close relatives had been taken seriously ill. After notifying the duty officers, he set out the same morning for his parents’ home in Tuy (Pontevedra), where he stayed until 24 February 1998. On 18 February 1998 members of the Tuy Civil Guard called at his parents’ home to check that he was there. On the same day a sergeant from the same garrison rang the family home in a further check. On 24 February the applicant rejoined his unit in Gijón. On 28 February 1998 the applicant was informed by a lieutenant-colonel in the Civil Guard that disciplinary proceedings had been brought against him for a minor breach of regulations, namely absence from his unit without prior leave. On 20 March	[2]	2	1	1
1201	 The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in the town of Kansk, Krasnoyarsk Region. On 19 March 2001 the applicant resisted a lawful arrest during a robbery and allegedly caused bodily harm to Mr F., officer of the Achinsk Department of the Interior, who was passing by with his wife. By a decision of 19 May 2001 an investigator of the Investigations Unit of the Achinsk Department of the Interior ordered the applicant's arrest. The applicant was arrested on 10 July 2002 and brought to the Achinsk police station (see also paragraph 13 below). It is unclear whether any investigative measures were taken during the initial period of his detention. On 24 July 2002 the applicant was charged with robbery. On 26 July 2002 the Achinsk Town Court considered that the applicant's arrest and detention had been unlawful because there had been deficiencies in the arrest record, in particular because he had not been informed of the above decision dated 19 May 2001; the app	[1]	2	1	0
1202	 The applicant, Mr Rémi Bertuzzi, was born in 1951 and lives in Saint-Laurent (département of Vosges). He applied to the Metz tribunal de grande instance for legal aid to bring an action in damages against Mr T., a lawyer, for failing to represent him properly in court proceedings. He was granted full legal aid on 1 June 1995. Three lawyers were assigned in turn by the president of the bar council to represent the applicant under the legal-aid scheme, but they applied for permission to withdraw from the case, owing to personal links with the lawyer the applicant wished to sue. The last of them withdrew from the case in late October or early November 1995. On 23 November 1995 the applicant asked the president of the legal-aid office to assign a fourth lawyer. On 27 November 1995 he made a like request to the president of the bar council. The registry of the legal-aid office forwarded the applicant's letter to a lawyer who had been delegated by the bar co	[3]	2	1	1
1203	 Until 1987 the applicant occupied a flat with his wife. In that year he moved out. On 28 June 1989 they divorced. On 16 September 1989 the applicant's former wife died.

Having waited for a long time to be attended to, the applicant started complaining. He alleges that he was then brutally beaten on his head by a police officer, Mr Georgantzis, while another police officer, Mr Giannopoulos, was holding him still. Other police officers to whom he turned for help insulted him and locked him in an empty office for three hours.

Until October 1994 the applicant lived in Aktaş, a village of Ovacık district in Tunceli province, in the then state-of-emergency region of Turkey. In 1994, terrorist activity was a major concern in this area. Since the 1980s a violent conflict had been going on in the region between the security forces and sections of the Kurdish population in favour of Kurdish autonomy, in particular members of the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan). The inhabitants of the applicant’s village were suspected of “aiding and abetting terrorists”; and accordingly they were strictly and frequently controlled by the gendarmes stationed near the village.

On the following day the Lubartów District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered his detention on remand for a period of three months on suspicion of armed robbery. It took into account the nature of the offence and the strong likelihood that the applicant would be given a heavy sentence. In addition, it had regard to the fact that the applicant had been previously convicted of a violent crime. On 14 September 1999 the Lublin Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) prolonged the applicant’s detention until 23 December 1999, having regard to the strong suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. It also found that the applicant’s detention was justified, given the gravity of the charge and the severity of the likely sentence.

The tenant told the applicant that she would not leave the premises. In a writ served on the tenant on 5 February 1986, the applicant reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Rome Magistrate. By a decision of 4 April 1986, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 August 1986.

On 8 June 2001 the bill of indictment was lodged. On 25 June 2001 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) extended the applicant’s detention until 15 January 2002. The court relied on a strong suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, which was supported by evidence. It attached importance to the grave nature of the offence and the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on him. In addition, keeping him in custody was necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings. Lastly, the court stressed that there were 3 co‑accused and 26 witnesses involved in the proceedings. O	[4]	2	1	0

In July 1996 he was charged with several counts of murder, abduction, bribery, unlawful possession of firearms and participation in a criminal gang. Between July 1996 and July 2002 various trial courts examined the applicant's case on six occasions, but each time they either returned it for an additional investigation or declined to examine it with reference to various reasons relating to jurisdiction. By a decision of 15 July 2002 the Tula Regional Court (Судебная коллегия по уголовным делам Тульского областного суда, “the Regional Court”) discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant for lack of evidence of his involvement in the imputed crimes.

On 5 June 2002 the Vilnius Region Administration restored his rights – restitution in natura – to the remainder of the land measuring 0.53 hectares, situated in the village of Gineitiškės. This plot of land was then entered in the land registry in the applicant’s name. In January 2005, having discovered that the decision of 5 June 2002 was based on erroneous data prepared by a State-hired land surveyor and had possibly breached the rights of other former landowners, the General Prosecutor’s Office instituted administrative proceedings to have the applicant’s title to the plot annulled. The applicant was a third party to those proceedings and argued that the restoration process had been lawful, without, however, raising the question of an adequate compensation in the event that his title to the plot was extinguished.

He met his female acquaintance who was in the company of two 17-year-old girls whom he had not met before. Afterwards, they all decided to leave the bar in a taxi. They dropped off the applicant’s acquaintance at her home and continued to the applicant’s apartment. The applicant, and apparently also the girls, continued drinking and talking. According to the statement given by the applicant in the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten), after a while he called a taxi for the girls and gave them money for the fare. He claims that the next time he heard of the girls was about four months later when the police contacted him and suspected him of a sexual offence.

On 21 December 1999 the Zielona Góra District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody until 19 March 2000 in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question and the fear that, given the severity of the anticipated penalty, he might go into hiding or otherwise obstruct the proceedings against him. On 1 February 2000 the Zielona Góra Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okręgowy) refused the applicant’s counsel’s request to release him under police supervision. The Prosecutor reasoned that there was the risk that the applicant would induce other suspects to give false testimony or attempt to disclose the anonymous witnesses.

On 29 November 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of committing a number of offences in an armed organised criminal group. On 6 December 2006 the Łódź District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody until 28 February 2007. The court relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences he had been accused of. The risk of the applicant fleeing was also taken into account as a ‘wanted’ notice (list gończy) against him had been issued in October 2006. At that time he had not been residing at his permanent address and his whereabouts had not been established. The court further anticipated a heavy prison sentence to be imposed on the applicant if convicted. The applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended by the Łódź Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) on 27 February 2007, 26 June 2007 and on 19 September 2007. Subsequently, it was extended 	[3]	2	1	0

From the Prime Minister to ministers, all statesmen and politicians keep on repeating it... it is used as a protective shield for ‘robbery and profiteering’. By mentioning stability at every opportunity some want to pave the way for a ‘religion based regime’. In sum, ‘the key word of the moderate regime’ that the Prime Minister and his men have set their minds on is primarily ‘stability’.

On the following day the Oktyabrskiy District Court of St. Petersburg accepted the investigator’s motion for the applicant’s remand in custody, having linked the necessity to detain him to the gravity of the charges against him and the risk of his absconding, reoffending and obstructing justice. In particular, the District Court noted the applicant’s potential to influence his accomplice, Mr G.

On 22 March 2001 the applicant’s son, S., who was forty-two years old, was taken by ambulance to the Simferopol Anti-Tuberculosis Clinic (“the hospital”), a public health-care institution, and hospitalised with the following diagnosis: left-sided pneumonia; tuberculosis of the left lung; haemoptysis; and pulmonary insufficiency. In the morning on 23 March 2001 the doctors noted, among other things, that S. was euphoric, behaved inadequately and complaining of dizziness. On the same date S. was X-rayed. S.’s state of health was characterised as serious. He was prescribed antibacterial, blood clotting and detoxification medicines. On 25 March 2001 the attending doctor noted that S.’s state of health had improved. On 26 March 2001 S. was X-rayed and offered a bronchoscopy, which would allow a specific diagnosis to be achieved and localise the source of bleeding he was suffering. The doctors noted t	[0]	3	1	0
1268	 The applicant was born in 1935 and lives in Vienna. The Bank für Arbeit und Wirtschaft AG (“Bank for Employment and Commerce”, hereafter “BAWAG”) was founded in 1922. According to its statutes, the objective of the bank was the pooling and prudent management of the financial means of the trade unions and cooperative organisations. The majority shareholder at the time was the Austrian Trades Union Federation (Österreichischer Gewerkschaftsbund, hereafter “the ÖGB” (70%)) together with the Konsum cooperatives (30%). After the Konsum cooperatives went bankrupt in 1995, the Bayerische Landesbank, a German bank, took over their shares. From 2004 on, the ÖGB was the only shareholder. On 1 October 2005 a merger between BAWAG and P.S.K., the Austrian postal savings bank, which had been privatized some time before, created the largest retail bank in Austria. Due to what became known as “the BAWAG affair” in which high losses were incurred, BAWAG P.S.K was sold on 15 May 2007 to a c	[]	3	1	1
1269	 The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Cinisello Balsamo (Milan). On 8 November 1989 the applicant's son was murdered by a criminal (M.R.) who had just robbed a bank with two accomplices (G.M. and G.B.). After leaving the bank the three robbers had failed to find the fourth accomplice (A.C.), who was supposed to be waiting for them with the getaway car. They had therefore made off on foot with the police in pursuit. Their path had then crossed a car being driven by A.Mastromatteo, the applicant's son. They had attempted to take control of the car, but it would appear that A.Mastromatteo had tried to get away from his attackers by accelerating, whereupon M.R. had shot him at point-blank range. He died a few hours later. The four criminals were subsequently identified and charged. Three of them (M.R., A.C. and G.M.) were serving prison sentences at the material time, whereas the fourth accomplice, G.B., was free. From the documents in the case file	[]	3	1	1

In 1986 the applicant was called up by the authorities to take part in emergency operations at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster. As a result, the applicant suffered from extensive exposure to radioactive emissions. In 1997 following an expert opinion of 14 April 1997, which established the link between the applicant’s poor health and his involvement in the Chernobyl events, the applicant was granted monthly health damage compensation. On 18 February 1999 the applicant brought proceedings against the Kurgan Social Security Service (МУ «Центр социальной защиты населения г. Кургана») to challenge the amount of compensation which he considered to be erroneous. On 12 May 1999 the Kurgan Town Court found for the applicant and ordered the Social Security Service to make monthly compensation payments of 1,350.58 Russian roubles (RUR) and pay outstanding amount due from 14 April 1997.

1294	 The applicant, a Swiss citizen born in 1912, is a pensioner living in Worben (Switzerland). Until 1994 the applicant, who draws an old-age pension, lived with her husband in a house belonging to He.M., one of her two sons, in Lyss in the Canton of Berne. As she was suffering from leg sores, she received help from the Lyss Association for Home Visits to the Sick and Housebound from 1987. In 1989 He.M. moved in. In 1994, at their request, the applicant and her husband were placed under the guardianship (Beistandschaft) of their other son, A.M. However, He.M. objected to this. At the end of 1994 the applicant's husband moved into the S. Nursing Home at Worben in the Canton of Berne. It was agreed that the applicant would also move in within a week, but she did not do so.

On 8 December 1995 the applicant appealed against that judgment, stating, inter alia, that her husband, the petitioner in the proceedings, had failed to satisfy the conditions set out in the Civil Code, as he had no rights in the assets he had offered to leave her. She argued in the alternative that a divorce would cause her exceptional hardship and that her husband's petition should be dismissed in accordance with Article 240 of the Civil Code, which empowered the court to dismiss a divorce petition if the respondent showed that “the divorce would cause the respondent ... or the children exceptional material or psychological 	[]	0	2	1

The applicant acted as counsel under the 1973 Cost-Free Proceedings Act (laki maksuttomasta oikeudenkäynnistä, lag om fri rättegång 87/1973) with the City Court's consent. In the 1992 trial the public prosecutor, T., requested that I.S., his brother S.S. and L.O. be temporarily barred from conducting business (liiketoimintakielto, näringsförbud). The request had been triggered by the winding up of various companies which the defendants had owned or in which they had held positions of trust. At a hearing on 4 March 1992 T. argued, inter alia, that regardless of whether S.S. had actually participated in the administration of the companies, he should be barred from conducting business, given his formal membership of their boards of directors. Evidence was heard from the companies' bookkeeper, M.H	[6]	0	2	1

The applicant appealed to the Court of Audit. On 9 September 1997 the Court of Audit upheld her appeal considering that she was entitled to an additional pension of 103,800 drachmas (GRD) per month for the period between 1 December 1991 and 31 December 1995 (judgment No. 1636/97).

Ten men within the group decided to go on hunger strike. The applicant's daughter joined her mother as one of the occupiers of the church. The movement, known as the “St Bernard sans papiers[1]” movement, was supported by several human-rights organisations, some of whose activists decided to sleep on the premises in a show of solidarity with their predicament.

In its finding, the Constitutional Court held, in particular, that what was at stake for the applicant required special diligence and that the District Court had remained inactive for approximately fifteen months. The Constitutional Court considered irrelevant that the delay was due to the heavy workload of the judges. On 8 November 2000 the Prešov District Court increased the maintenance due by the applicant’s former husband with retroactive effect. The applicant appealed and claimed that the increase awar	[3]	0	2	0

The District Court, having heard the applicant and having regard to the written opinions of the psychiatric experts Prof. R. and Dr O. of 28 August 1991, and of the psychological expert Prof. D. of 1 September 1991, considered that the applicant was a male-to-female transsexual.

1365	 The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Pesaro (Italy). The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. By a writ filed on 11 March 1993 C.R., a bank, brought proceedings against Mrs Tierce before the Commissario della legge (“the Commissario”) seeking termination of her lease and an eviction order against her for non-payment of her rent. On 26 March 1993 the Commissario authorised the commencement of the action against the applicant and summoned the parties to appear on 7 April 1993. As the applicant did not attend the hearing the case was listed for 7 May 1993. On 29 April 1993 the applicant deposited with the registry a bankbook (libretto al portatore), mentioning a sum to be handed over to the claimant bank if it were to accept a settlement out of court. On 13 May 1993 C.R. claimed the sum in question, the Commissario ordered notification of the claim to the applicant and gave her five days to file her submissions	[3]	1	2	1
1366	 The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Spånga. In 1935 the applicant’s mother and her four siblings jointly inherited two estates – Marum 1:6 and Marum 1:8 – from their father. The ownership of the estates, consisting of several islands in the archipelago of Stockholm, was over the years partly transferred to other members of the family. Disagreements arose between the family members. Some of them wished to divide the property (klyvning) and thus dissolve the joint ownership, but the applicant’s mother opposed this idea. On the land managed by the applicant’s mother – which formed part of Marum 1:8 – the mother owned a number of houses. Two of the houses were used by the applicant’s two sisters. A third house situated on the property was considered too small for the applicant’s needs and it was therefore decided to enlarge it. The applicant applied for a building permit to the Österåker Building Committee (byggnadsnämnden). On 9 September 1987, finding that	[9]	2	2	1

In 1979 the applicant’s sister and her husband filed with the Kluczbork District Court (sąd rejonowy) an action in which they requested that the co-ownership of the house shared by them with the applicant be dissolved. They sought to be granted the sole ownership of the house on payment of a compensation to the applicant. In 1981 the District Court dismissed the action. In 1982 the Opole Regional Court (sąd wojewódzki) quashed that judgment and remitted the case for re-examination.

By a letter of 7 January 1994 the Health Care Centre No. 1 in Gdynia submitted that, as a result of organisational changes, it was the Gdynia‑Śródmieście Specialised Clinic which had standing to be a defendant in the case. On 1 March 1994 the court summoned the Gdynia-Śródmieście Specialised Clinic to become a party to the proceedings. On 29 April 1996 the court ordered that expert opinions of a neurologist and urologist be prepared.

1369	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Around 7.25 p.m. on 12 February 1989 the applicant's husband, solicitor Patrick Finucane, was killed in front of her and their three children by two masked men who broke into their home. She herself was injured, probably by a ricochet bullet. Patrick Finucane was shot in the head, neck and chest. Six bullets had struck the head and there was evidence that one or more of these had been fired within a range of 15 inches when he was lying on the floor. The day after the murder, 13 February 1989, a man telephoned the press and stated that the illegal loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) claimed responsibility for killing Patrick Finucane – the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA) officer – not the solicitor. Patrick Finucane represented clients from both sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland and was involved in a number of high-profile cases arising fro	[0]	2	2	1

In December 1994 the applicant petitioned for divorce. By a judgment of 5 September 1996, the Nîmes tribunal de grande instance ruled on the divorce petition. It found, firstly, that a reading of the submitted documents had not established that the applicant's membership of the Jehovah's Witnesses had been the cause of the break-down in the couple's relationship, but that it had been attested that her husband had left the matrimonial home to live with his mistress, and had also prevented the applicant from working in the pizzeria they ran. Accordingly, it granted the divorce, attributing fault to the husband alone. With regard to the childre	[4, 8]	2	2	1

On 3 October 1996 the applicant brought an action requesting that a flat which she had purchased from a third person, Mrs I.S., be vacated. In the meantime, Mrs I.S. brought an action before the same court challenging the validity of the contract of sale. On 2 April 1997 the Pest Central District Court suspended the proceedings relating to the applicant's action pending the outcome of the dispute over the validity of the contract of sale.

However, the economic and political problems of Turkey have not been solved since that date. The conditions for association have not been established either.  On the other hand, the founders of the European Union are not keen on taking on board a huge problem with its fifteen million unemployed people and serious economic and social problems. Considering the still unresolved problems of German unification and the unexpected economic integration of East European countries, the acceptance of Turkey by the Community definitely seems impossible.

The patient's top rib had been pressing on her artery, thereby hampering the blood flow in her left arm which would occasionally go numb. The surgery had consisted of shortening the top rib by 5-8 centimetres. Complications had arisen after the rib had been shortened and the patient was established to have died from the bursting of her subclavian vein and the blood flow into her pleural cavity.

1466	 The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Valencia. The applicant has lived in a flat in a residential quarter of Valencia since 1970. Since 1974 the Valencia City Council has allowed licensed premises such as bars, pubs and discotheques to open in the vicinity of her home, making it impossible for people living in the area to sleep. Local residents first complained about vandalism and noise in the locality before 1980. In view of the problems caused by the noise, the Valencia City Council resolved on 22 December 1983 not to permit any more night clubs to open in the area. However, the resolution was never implemented and new licences were granted. In 1993 the City Council commissioned a report by an expert. The expert found that the noise levels were unacceptable and exceeded permitted levels. At 3.35 a.m. on Saturdays they were in excess of 100 dBA Leq (decibels), ranging from 101 to 115.9 dBA Leq.

1468	 The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Novosibirsk. Since 1991 the applicant has been receiving an old-age pension. From 1 February 1998 the amount of her pension was to be determined by the Law on Calculating and Upgrading State Pensions (the “Pensions Law”). The Pensions Law introduced a new method of upgrading retirement benefits—“Individual Pensioner Coefficient” (“the IPC”). The IPC, established for the purpose of calculating individual pensions, was the ratio between the individual’s final wages at retirement and the national average wage, and was meant to maintain a link between a person’s pension and previous earnings. The authority in charge of the applicant’s pension—the Pension Fund Agency of the Zayeltsovskiy District of Novosibirsk (“the Agency”)—decided that the IPC to be applied to her should be 0.525.

The judgment stated that the house had been taken away from the applicant's parents pursuant to President Beneš's Decree No. 108/1945, in 1945, and that the possibility of restoring property under the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitations Act extended only to cases where the property had been taken away between 25 February 1948 and 1 January 1990. The applicant appealed. She claimed that she had acquired the house in question as an heir following her mother's death in 1941. She concluded that the subsequent confiscation of the house had been void as at that time her parents no longer owned it and that she had never stopped being the owner of the property. On 31 May 1994 the applicant authorised her son to represent her in the proceedings. </	[3]	0	2	0

On 29 March 1996, Talat Türkoğlu travelled by bus from Istanbul to Edirne, a city near the border with Greece, to visit relatives. During its journey to Edirne, the bus was stopped by a car and a person from this car got on the bus. Before its arrival in Edirne the same car stopped the bus once again and the person who had got on the bus earlier returned to the car. This car followed Talat Türkoğlu until he arrived at his relatives' house in Edirne. On 1 April 1996 Talat Türkoğlu left Edirne for Istanbul. He did not arrive home and has been missing since.

Between 10 May 1990 and 13 September 1999, the bailiff made twenty-one attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as t	[1]	3	2	1
1481	 The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Hälleforsnäs. As from 1990, the applicant received a pension from the Swedish State in addition to the pension she received from the Finnish State. By a decision of 10 February 1995 the Stockholm Social Insurance Office (försäkringskassan) fixed her Swedish pension at 3,754 Swedish kronor (SEK) per month. As from 1996 the applicant was attached to the Social Insurance Office in Flen. Apparently, in August 1997 the entry in the computerised pension register concerning her pension was changed so that, as from September 1997, she received a monthly pension of SEK 776 from Sweden. The applicant received a notice that the amount had been deposited on her bank account from the Flen office. Later investigations revealed that the entry in the pension register had been made by the Stockholm office. The applicant’s case file, however, disappeared and she did not receive a formal decision concerning the reduction of her pension. Nevertheles	[1]	3	2	1

On 17 January 1997 at 18.45 p.m. the car of which the applicant is the registered owner was caught in Austria by a radar-trap exceeding the speed limit by 26 km/h. On 12 March 1997 the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) ordered the applicant pursuant to section 103 § 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act (Kraftfahrzeuggesetz) to disclose within two weeks the full name and address of the person who had been driving her car at the material time on 17 January 1997. On 24 March 1997 the applicant replied that Mr J.S. [first and family name in full], living in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina had been the driver. On 17 April 1997 the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority issued a provisional penal order (Strafverfügung) in which it sentenced the applicant under sections 103 § 2 and 134 § 1 of the Motor Vehicles Act to pay a fine of 1,500 Austrian schillings (ATS) wi	[]	2	2	1
1483	 The applicant was born in 1923 and lives in Liptovský Mikuláš. The father of the applicant owned a residential house. At some point in the late 1940s or early 1950s the house was expropriated and attributed to a State company. The applicant's father died in 1959. On 23 January 1991 the applicant lodged a demand with the State company for restoration of the house to her under the Extra‑Judicial Rehabilitations Act (Law no. 87/1991 Coll.). On 25 March 1992 the applicant filed a claim against the State company with the Liptovský Mikuláš District Court (Okresný súd) for the restitution of the house. In response to the District Court's request the applicant clarified and supplemented her original submission on 4 November 1992. On 9 September 1993 the applicant submitted a further specification of the subject‑matter of her action. On 14 September 1993 the District Court held a hearing.

1484	 The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Lefkoşa, in the northern Cyprus, “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”). The application concerns the killing of the applicant's husband, Mr Kutlu Adalı, by unknown persons. The applicant made serious allegations about the involvement of Turkish and/or “TRNC” agents in the murder. She further complained of the inadequacy of the investigation launched by the “TRNC” authorities into the death of Kutlu Adalı. She contended that her husband had received death threats on several occasions because of his articles and political opinions. The applicant further complained that following the death of her husband she had been subjected to continuing practices of harassment, intimidation and discrimination by the “TRNC” authorities. In this connection, she referred to several incidents. The Government denied all allegations concerning the murder of Kutlu Adalı. They maintained that the “TRNC” authorities had immediately 	[0, 7]	2	2	0
1485	 The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant and her family (her husband and two children, born in 1982 and 1987) moved into a dormitory in Volgograd in 1985. They occupied two rooms in the dormitory, with shared kitchen, shower and toilet facilities. They were registered as living in the dormitory permanently, which was their sole residence. In 1993 the ownership of the dormitory was transferred to a company called “VNIITMASH”. In 1995 the applicant, along with other residents, was ordered by the District Prosecutor of the Sovetskiy district of Volgograd to vacate the premises because the building required urgent structural renovation. The applicant was provided with temporary housing in another dormitory in Volgograd, although smaller and of inferior quality. In August 1995 the applicant was forcibly evicted from the building and her belongings were transferred. The applicant, along with other residen	[3]	0	2	0

On 3 July 1998 the applicant was arrested on the suspicion of shooting her husband, Lieutenant-General Lev Rokhlin, a member of the Russian Parliament. An investigator of the Moscow Region prosecutor's office authorised her detention on remand. The applicant was placed in detention facility no. IZ-49/9 in the Moscow Region. On 8 July 1998 the applicant was charged with murder under Article 105 § 1 of the Criminal Code and questioned as an accused in the presence of Mr Vankovich, a lawyer retained by her. She chose to remain silent on the merits of the charge against her and requested that the investigator be replaced because he had allegedly intimidated her and showed lack of respect for her and her family. On an unspecified date the applicant's request was rejected as unsubstantiated. On 16 July 1998 the State Duma of the Russian Federation (the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament) established a 	[2, 3]	2	2	0

On 16 October 1992 officers of the Regional Vienna Labour Office (Landesarbeitsamt) inspected the construction site and found that four persons of Czech nationality, who were carrying out plaster works, had no permit to work in Austria. On 21 October 1992 the Labour Office submitted a report to the Vienna Municipal Office (Magistrat) alleging that the applicant had illegally employed four foreigners. Thereupon, the Municipal Office opened administrative criminal proceedings against the applicant under the Aliens' Employment Act (Ausländerbeschäftigungsgesetz) and invited her, by letter of 29 December 1992, to comment on the charge against her. As the applicant was out of town, this letter did not reach her prior to 20 January 1993, when the Municipal Office ordered the applicant to pay a fine in 	[3]	2	2	1
1488	 The applicant, Ms Khadra Mohammed Yuusuf, is a Somali national, who was born in 1965 and lives in Sint Maartensdijk (Netherlands). The applicant, her husband and their two children entered the Netherlands on 10 October 1994. They were given temporary accommodation in a refugee holding centre. While in the holding centre the applicant twice got into fights, in connection with which she was prosecuted and tried. She was sentenced to a fine of 500 Netherlands guilders (NLG), or ten days' detention in lieu, suspended for two years. Three further children were born to the applicant and her husband after their arrival in the Netherlands. The applicant, her husband and their children lodged applications for asylum in the Netherlands or, in the alternative, residence permits on humanitarian grounds. They were initially met with a refusal and pursued their case in objection and appeal proceedings. On 6 October 2000, the competent administrative	[3]	2	2	1
1489	 The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Rouse. In 1976 the applicant started working for the Cargo Railway Station in Rouse and until 1989 she formally occupied the positions of dormitories supervisor and facilities and social activities co‑ordinator. In fact, throughout this period the applicant was working – under the instructions of her manager – as a typist at the local section of the Bulgarian Communist Party. This scheme had apparently been devised because the staff tables did not provide for a typist position. Accordingly, the applicant's employment agreements and job descriptions did not mention her actual duties, which included mostly typewriting. This arrangement was apparently never called into question by the applicant or her employer. Between 1989 and 1996 the applicant worked as an inspector at the human resources department of the Station.

On 2 March 1995 the person responsible for the accident was convicted of an offence. On 16 October 1995 the applicant filed an action with the Bratislava V District Court. She claimed compensation for her maintenance from the person responsible for the accident. On 12 April 1996 the District Court judge instructed the court’s registry to obtain the criminal file relating to the death of the applicant’s husband and to notify the defendant of the action. On 4 July 1996 the postal authority informed the District Court, in reply to its request, that the letter could not be served on the defendant. On 6 February 1997 the District Court asked the applicant’s representative to submit further information. The representative complied with the request on 9 April 1997.

1491	 The applicant was born in 1923 and lives in Košice. On 8 May 1995 the applicant filed an action with the Poprad District Court. She sued a private company which had constructed a building on her plot of land. The applicant claimed that legal relations between her and the defendant be settled and that easement be imposed in that context. On 30 May 1995 the defendant submitted observations on the applicant’s claim. He informed the court that a similar issue was being determined in a different set of proceedings pending before the appellate court. In July 1995 the parties submitted further information at the court’s request. Subsequently the judge dealing with the case sought to obtain the file concerning the other set of proceedings allegedly relating to the same issue. That file was returned from the appellate court on 31 May 1996. On 6 June 1996 the District Court asked the applicant to submit further information. The applicant replied on 15 July 1996.

Čillíková (the sister of the applicant) and Mr J. Bôbik (the applicant’s brother) informed the Court of their wish to pursue the application in the applicant’s stead. By a decision which became final on 28 January 1998 the applicant’s and her former husband’s joint tenancy in respect of a flat was terminated. The Bratislava Regional Court decided that the applicant’s former husband should remain the sole tenant of the flat and ordered the applicant to move out of it within fifteen days after she has been provided with alternative accommodation. In the reasons for the judgment the Regional Court explicitly held that the applicant was entitled to use the flat until her former husband found appropriate accommodation for her. However, her former husband did not allow the applicant to enter the flat. She was therefore obliged to tem	[3]	2	2	0
1493	 The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Zagreb. On 14 April 1992 the applicant's house in Vinkovci, Croatia was blown up by unknown perpetrators. On 12 July 1993 the applicant, together with her husband, filed a civil action with the Vinkovci Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Vinkovcima) against the State seeking damages in the amount of 847,671 Croatian kunas (HRK) for her destroyed property. She relied on section 180 of the Civil Obligations Act. The court held hearings on 15 December 1993, 5 January and 22 March 1994 and 6 February 1996. On 3 February 1996 the Amendment to the Civil Obligations Act (“the 1996 Amendment”) entered into force. It provided that all proceedings concerning actions for damages resulting from terrorist acts were to be stayed pending enactment of new legislation on the subject.

On 8 January 1992 she sought compensation from her former employer before the Galanta District Court. The applicant also submitted an expert opinion. In the course of 1992 and 1993 the District Court held 12 hearings. On 8 April 1994 the District Court decided to obtain a second expert opinion. The defendant challenged the decision ordering him to pay an advance on expert’s fees. On 31 August 1994 the appellate court determined that issue. On 22 September 1994 the District Court decided to obtain an opinion from a different expert. On 1 December 1994 and on 9 March 1995 the court urged the expert to submit the opinion.

1495	 On 9 January 1997 the applicant gave birth to a girl. She stated to the authorities that the father of the child was a Yugoslav national living in Switzerland. On 18 April 1997 the Humenné District Court heard the applicant on the issue of the paternity of her child. On 22 December 1997 the Prešov District Court appointed the Snina District Office as guardian to the child for the purpose of bringing paternity proceedings on her behalf and representing her in such proceedings. The decision stated that it had been taken as the applicant had not filed a paternity action. The District Office received the decision on 23 December 1997, but it did not bring paternity proceedings. On 3 June 1999 the Prešov Regional Office admitted, in reply to the applicant’s complaint, that the Snina District Office by its failure to file an action had delayed the case. On 17 August 1998 paternity proceedings were instituted, at the applicant’s request, before the Prešov Distric	[3]	0	2	0

In the night of 1 August 1997, in the thirty-fifth week of pregnancy, the embryo asphyxiated in the womb. On 4 August 1997 the applicant gave birth to a stillborn baby boy and decided to bury him. On 13 August 1997 the stillbirth was registered by the Chertanovskiy branch of the Civil Acts Registration Service (Чертановский отдел ЗАГС). Mr Z., who had been the applicant's husband until their divorce on 25 March 1997, was entered as the stillbirth's father in the birth certificate (акт о рождении) and in the birth register (книга записей рождений). The applicant submitted that the biological father of the stillbirth had been Mr G., with whom she had been living as man and wife since 1994.

1497	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in the town of Cherepovets, an important steel-producing centre approximately 300 kilometres north-east of Moscow. In 1982 her family moved to a flat situated at 1 Zhukov Street, approximately 450 metres from the site of the Severstal steel plant (“the plant”). This flat was provided by the plant to the applicant's husband, Mr Nikolay Fadeyev, under a tenancy agreement. The plant was built during the Soviet era and was owned by the Ministry of Black Metallurgy of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). The plant was, and remains, the largest iron smelter in Russia and the main employer for approximately 60,000 people. In order to delimit the areas in which the pollution caused by steel production might be excessive, the authorities established a buffer zone around the Severstal premises – “the sanitary security zone”. This zone was first delimited in 1965. It covered a 5,000-metre-wide area around the site of the	[4]	2	2	0

The decision had retroactive effect as of 27 November 1995. On 17 January 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings challenging the lawfulness of the Faculty's decision. She claimed to have never been reinstated, as was required by a final court decision from proceedings she had previously instituted against the Faculty, and that she could therefore not have been dismissed. On 12 July 1999 the Osijek Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Osijeku) ruled in the applicant's favour, ordering the Faculty to reinstate her. Following an appeal by the Faculty, on 28 October 1999 the Osijek County Court (Županijski sud u Osijeku) upheld the first instance judgment.

She applied to a Mental Health Review Tribunal (“MHRT”) for her discharge from detention in hospital. On 24 May 1999 the MHRT first considered her application. It adjourned in order, inter alia, to obtain a psychiatric report from a Dr Hamilton which was to address the eligibility of the applicant for a conditional discharge from hospital. On 16 August 1999 the MHRT resumed its hearing of the applicant's application. It had before it the report of Dr Hamilton, which expressed the view that the applicant was not ready for discharge.

On 30 November 2000 the applicant was dismissed from her position in the State Holding Company “Torezantratsit” (the “SHC”). In July 2000 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Torez City Court against the SHC seeking to recover salary owed to her. On 7 August 2000 the Torez City Court allowed her claims and ordered the SHC to pay the applicant UAH 2,379.76[1] in compensation. On 14 June 2001 the Torez Execution Service informed the applicant that the judgment of 7 August 2000 could not be executed due to the SHC’s lack of funds.

The applicant was offered a substitute flat in a remote area of Yuzhnoye Butovo. After the applicant had rejected the offer, the Council sued her for eviction and resettlement. On 27 September 2001 the Babushkinskiy District Court of Moscow found for the Council. It ordered the applicant's eviction from her old flat and transferred her title in it to the Council's account. It also held that the new flat in Yuzhnoye Butovo should be transferred into the applicant's ownership. On 6 December 2001 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 27 September 2001.

In the winter of 1998 the applicant was taken to a hospital in the town of Bilibino. According to the applicant, local doctors failed to diagnose her correctly and provide adequate treatment; as a result her health was seriously damaged. In August 1998 the applicant brought a medical malpractice suit against the municipal health protection institution “Bilibino Central District Hospital” (муниципальное учреждение здравоохранения «Билибинская центральная районная больница»). On 21 February 2000 the Bilibinskiy District Court of the Chukotka Region allowed the applicant's action and awarded her RUR 60,000 (EUR 2,109).

She had a passport and a tourist visa. It had been agreed that she would work at Mrs D.'s home until the cost of her air ticket had been reimbursed and that Mrs D. would attend to her immigration status and find her a place at school. In reality, the applicant became an unpaid housemaid for Mr and Mrs D. and her passport was taken from her. In the second half of 1994, Mrs D. “lent” the applicant to Mr and Mrs B., who had two small children, so that she could assist the pregnant Mrs B. with household work. Mrs B. also had another daughter from a first marriage who stayed with her during the holidays and at weekends. The applicant lived at Mr and Mrs B.'s home, her father having given his consent.

The applicant did not agree to a divorce and asked the court to dismiss the petition. On 1 November 1997 the court made an interim periodical payments order requiring the applicant’s husband to pay 2,500 Polish zlotys (PLN) for maintenance in respect of their 3 children pending the proceedings. On 21 September 1999 the Poznań Regional Court granted a decree of divorce.

In a registered letter of 10 May 1985, A.C. informed the tenant that she intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 30 April 1986 and asked her to vacate the premises by that date. In a writ served on the tenant on 10 July 1985, A.C. reiterated her intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Rome Magistrate. By a decision of 14 November 1985, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 May 1986. On 29 May 1986, A.C. served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises.

The court declared that both spouses should retain full and unrestricted parental rights with respect to their minor daughter M., born on 3 May 1984, but it ordered that she should live with her mother. Since the applicant could not reach an agreement with his former wife as to the exercise of custody, on 24 November 1992 he requested the Toruń District Court to determine the access arrangements. On 11 May 1993 the court ordered that M. should visit the applicant twice a month for weekends. They were also to spend one month together during the summer holidays and one week during the winter holidays. In the meantime, between June 1992 and 23 October 1993, the applicant made a number of unsuccessful attempts to see his child. The applicant therefore instituted enforcement proceedings on 8 June 1993, following the decision of 11 May 1993.

On 2 July 1993 the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) dismissed her claim. On appeal, on 6 February 1996 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case. In the resumed proceedings, the court held several hearings and heard two witnesses through the Biograd Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Biogradu). On 1 June 1999 the Zagreb Municipal Court gave a new judgment awarding the applicant the damages in part. Both parties appealed. On 5 December 2000 the Zagreb County Court again quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case. In the resumed proceedings, on 8 March 2001 the court requested the applicant to provide the addresses of the witness	[3]	3	2	0
1603	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Ruše. On 15 January 1992 the applicant instituted denationalization proceedings in the Ruše Municipality (Občina Ruše) seeking restitution of a property previously owned by her grandmother. On 17 April 1992 the Municipality forwarded the applicant’s claim to the Maribor Basic Court, Maribor Unit (Temeljno Sodišče v Mariboru, enota v Mariboru). The court dismissed her claim twice and declared a lack of jurisdiction in the case. However, both decisions had been quashed on appeal and the case was ultimately considered by the renamed Maribor Local Court (Okrajno Sodišče v Mariboru). On 28 June 1994 the Convention entered into force with respect to Slovenia. Of the four hearings held between 8 December 1994 and 27 May 1999, none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. On 5 May 2000 the court gave a judgement dismissing the applicant’s claim. On 23 May 2000 the applicant appealed to the Maribor Higher Court (Višje sodiš	[3]	2	2	0
1604	 The applicant was born in 1964 and is now serving her sentence in Irkutsk. On 5 March 1998 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having arranged a contracted murder of two persons in 1995 and 1996. On the following day, pursuant to an order of the Usolye-Sibirskoye district prosecutor, she was remanded in custody for ten days. The order referred to the gravity of the “committed crime” and the applicant’s potential to interfere with the establishment of the truth. On 16 March 1998 the prosecutor authorised the applicant’s detention pending investigation. On 15 April 1998 the Irkutsk Regional Prosecutor authorised an extension of the applicant’s detention until 27 August 1998. The decision summarised the collected evidence and referred to the need for additional investigative actions. On 24 November 1998 a deputy Prosecutor General extended the applicant’s detention until 27 February 1999, noting that further investigation was needed. On 16 	[2]	2	2	0
1605	 The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Bratislava. In 1989 the applicant’s daughter was seriously injured in a road traffic accident. The driver, who had been originally accused and convicted of having negligently caused bodily harm in that accident, was acquitted by a judgment of 20 February 1992. A driver of a different vehicle, who was an employee of the Ministry of the Interior, was subsequently accused of an offence in the context of that accident. The applicant submits that, due to misconduct on the part of the State officials, the criminal proceedings lasted an excessively long time and that, until the liability of the drivers involved had been determined, the insurance company refused to compensate her for her daughter’s injuries. As a result the applicant became heavily indebted and she was in a difficult situation. On 18 June 1992 the applicant filed a claim for damages with the Ministry of Justice. On 25 June 1992 the Ministry of 	[3]	3	2	0
1606	 The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Banská Bystrica. On 20 February 1992 the applicant filed an action with the Banská Bystrica District Court. She claimed that a joint ownership be terminated in respect of several plots of land and a house. On 6 April 1992 the court summoned the applicant’s advocate and asked him to inform the court whether the applicant maintained her claim. On 18 June 1992 the court held a hearing where it heard both parties and invited them to submit further evidence. The defendant lodged a counterclaim and the court requested him to specify it. On 13 July 1992 and on 2 September 1992 the court asked the State Notary in Banská Bystrica to submit case files concerning three sets of inheritance proceedings in which the applicant had been involved. On 30 November 1992 the applicant amended her action and requested that another person should be joined as a defendant in the case. The court held hearings 	[3]	3	2	0
1607	 The applicant, Ms Nada Kostovska, is a national of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, who was born in 1920 and lives in Skopje. The applicant and her close family shared a plot of building land with the family of the applicant’s niece and nephew, Mrs M.F.Z. and Mr J.F. Both families have constructed their own family houses on it. A small house and a shed existed on the plot, ownership of which was disputed in the proceedings complained of. On 9 March 1982, the applicant and her husband instituted civil proceedings against Mrs M.F.Z. and Mr J.F. for determination of the ownership over the house and the shed and for recognition of the usus rights over the land. On 19 June 1984 the Skopje I Municipality Court (Општински Суд Скопје I) partly upheld the applicant’s and her husband’s claim and awarded them ownership title over the house and the shed and the right to use the land.

1608	 The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Novovoronezh. The applicant receives an old-age pension. From April 1998 to April 1999 she received her pension several months in arrears. According to the applicant, inflation during this period meant that the pension paid several months in arrears had lost significant part of its value by the time it was paid. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an action against the Novovoronezh Social-Security Authority for index-linking of her pension in line with inflation. On 27 October 2000 the Novovoronezh Town Court of the Voronezh Region found for the applicant and ordered the defendant authority to pay the applicant 2,044.87 Russian roubles (RUR) as the pension indexation and RUR 91.79 as a court fee. The defendant authority did not appeal against the judgment. On 7 November 2000 the judgment came into force. On 21 November 2000 the Town Court issued a writ of execution for the total amount	[3, 9]	3	2	0
1609	 The applicant is a Russian national who was born in Russia in 1948 and lives in Riga (Latvia). In 1970, at the age of twenty-two, the applicant settled in Latvian territory for work-related reasons. Between 1973 and 1980, the year of her divorce, she was married to a man resident in Latvia. In 1973 she gave birth to a son, Jevgeņijs Ševanovs, who has lived with her until the present day. In 1981, having lost the Soviet passport issued to her in 1978, the applicant obtained a new passport. In 1989 she found the lost passport, but did not return it to the relevant authorities. In August 1991 Latvia regained full independence. In December 1991 the Soviet Union, the State of which the applicant had hitherto been a national, broke up. The applicant therefore became stateless. In August 1992 her name was entered in the register of residents (Iedzīvotāju reģistrs) as a permanent resident. Her son was subsequently granted the status of “permanently resident non-citizen	[4]	0	2	0
1610	 The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Nové Zámky. On 18 August 1995 the applicant and her husband entered into a contract for the purchase of a family house and a plot of land from Mr and Mrs D. Mr D., who was registered as permanently resident (trvalý pobyt) at the house’s address, undertook in the contract to secure his deregistration by 21 August 1995. The applicant and her husband then became the owners of the property and moved into the house. However, Mr D. failed to deregister himself from the relevant register, which was kept by the municipal office (Obecný úrad) of Nové Zámky. In a letter of 2 March 2001 in reply to the applicant’s enquiry, the Nové Zámky district prosecutor (Okresný prokurátor) informed her that registration of permanent places of residence was governed by the Registration of Citizens’ Place of Residence Act (Law no. 135/1982, see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below) in conjunction with the Regulation on En	[4]	2	2	0
1611	 The applicant, Mrs Alla Zakharovna Kirsanova, is a Russian national, who was born in 1955 and lives in the village of Novoselye of the Lomonosovskiy District of the Leningradskiy Region. On 28 May 1997 the St-Petersburg City Council (“the City Council”, Администрация Санкт-Петербурга) took a decision to grant the applicant’s family the right to reside in a flat situated in the village of Novoselye. It appears that soon after the applicant moved in, she discovered that the flat had been built with constructional defects. On 14 September 1998 the applicant and her family members filed a civil claim against a private company which had built the flat in question in the Lomonosovskiy District Court of the Leningradskiy Region, (“the Lomonosovskiy District Court”, Ломоносовский районный суд Ленинградской области).

1612	 The applicant, who is of Georgian origin, was born in 1958 in Georgia and has lived in Riga (Latvia) since 1984. She was a Soviet national until 1991 and now has no nationality. In 1982 the applicant, who was living in Russia at the time, married a Soviet civil servant employed by the USSR Ministry of the Interior. In 1984 the couple had a daughter, born in Russia. In the same year the applicant and her family settled in Latvian territory. In 1987 the applicant’s husband was granted the right, in a professional capacity, to rent a room in a “duty residence” in Riga. In July 1988 he exchanged the accommodation he had previously been renting in Kazan (Russia) for the right to rent a State-owned flat in Riga. He and his family moved in straight away. On 16 March 1990 the applicant cancelled her formal registration of residence (known at the time as пропucкa in Russian and pieraksts or dzīvesvietas reģistrācija in Latvian) in Volzhsk (Russia).

1613	 The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Šoštanj. On 24 August 1998 the applicant was injured in a car accident. The perpetrator of the accident had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZM. On 8 April 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZM in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 4,136,681 Slovenian tolars (approximately 17,240 euros) for the injuries sustained. On 19 January 2000 and 17 October 2002 the applicant lodged preliminary written submissions. On 19 January and 16 October 2001 she made requests that a date be set for a hearing. Of the two hearings held on 19 February and 5 November 2002, neither was adjourned at the request of the applicant. During the proceedings, the court appointed a medical expert. At the last hearing, the parties reached a conditional court settlement. On 6 November 2002 ZM revoked the settlement and the court consequently delivered a written judgment. The	[3]	2	2	0
1614	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Velenje. On 14 December 1998 the Velenje Unit of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund (“the PDIF”) awarded the applicant an invalidity status of fifth degree for the period after 12 December 1996. On 17 August 1999 the PDIF rejected the applicant’s appeal. On 22 September 1999 the applicant instituted proceedings against the PDIF in the Ljubljana Labour and Social Court (Delovno in socialno sodišče v Ljubljani) contesting, inter alia, the date of the occurrence of the injury. Between 25 October 1999 and 16 September 2002 the applicant lodged three written submissions. Between 17 January 2001 and 8 March 2002 she made three requests that a date be set for a hearing. On 1 October 2002 a hearing was held and the court delivered a judgment. The judgment, rejecting the applicant’s claim, was served on the applicant on 29 October 2002.

1615	 The applicant was born in 1916 and lives in the village of Kolodeznoye, the Voronezh Region. According to the applicant, a number of third persons unlawfully occupied a part of her house. On 8 August 1997 she filed a civil action with the Voronezh Region Kashirskiy District Court (“the District Court”) in which she sought the eviction of a number of third persons. On 12 August 1997 the statement of claim and supporting documents reached the District Court. By decision of 15 January 1998 the District Court accepted the case for examination. It appears that a proper resolution of the dispute required questioning of a person living in the town of Yuzhnosakhalinsk. On 10 April 1998 the District Court made such request to the Yuzhnosakhalinskiy District Court. According to the Government, the hearings in the case were suspended pending the response. On an unspecified date the District Court received the transcripts of the 	[3]	3	2	0

On an unspecified date, the applicant’s husband withdrew all of the money from their joint account without the applicant’s consent and placed it into another account in a Turkish bank. On 23 October 1992 the applicant filed an action with the Aydın Civil Court of first-instance to recover half the money that her husband had withdrawn from their joint bank account. On 14 September 1999 the Aydın Civil Court of first-instance dismissed the applicant’s case on the ground that she had failed to substantiate her claims. The court reasoned that the applicant had not furnished any bank document, such as receipts indicating withdrawal of money, capable of supporting her allegations. It also noted that the documents kept by the bank had been destroyed at the end of six years’ retention period an	[3]	2	2	0
1618	 The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Tel-Aviv. On 27 August 1993 the applicant was severely injured in a traffic accident in Moscow.

1619	 The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in the city of Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. From November 1994 until September 1996 the applicant worked as a lawyer in the Avers Ltd. auditing company (hereinafter – the “Company”), of which she was a shareholder. Her share in the Company’s capital was 30 %.

1620	 The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in the city of Yalta, Ukraine. In March 2000 the applicant lodged a claim with the Yalta City Court against the local social welfare department, challenging the refusal of the latter to award her a higher pension. In her claim, the applicant maintained that, under Article 46 of the Constitution and Article 19 of the Law on Pensions, her pension should not be lower than the minimum living standard. Therefore, given that her pension was fixed at UAH 74.70 per month and the minimum living standard was established at UAH 118.30 per month, the applicant claimed a corresponding increase in her pension. On 4 April 2000 the court decided against the applicant. The court established in particular that, although Article 19 of the Law on Pensions provided the possibility for a higher pension, it also limited the amount to a maximum sum which the applicant in fact received. The court did not consider the applicant’s argument about the	[3]	2	2	0

Subsequent to having suffered severe problems with her jaw, resulting in her being able to open her mouth only 5 millimetres, on 19 April 1988 at a hospital in Hillerød the applicant underwent a jaw operation which entailed implanting Teflon in both her jaw-joints. Following the surgery, the applicant's ability to open her mouth was improved. She could thus open her mouth up to 20 millimetres. However, she experienced a lot of complications. Having regard thereto and due to a debate among doctors as to the potential danger related to the use of Teflon, in April 1990, the applicant had it removed.

1633	 The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Moscow. On 22 November 1994 the applicant and her husband bought a flat. In addition, they agreed to lend a certain sum to the seller.  After the applicant had paid for the flat, the seller refused to transfer the title and move out. The applicant and her husband sued her for eviction. The seller counterclaimed and requested a court to annul the contract and to order restitutio in integrum. On 4 June 1997 the Moscow City Court, in the final instance, found for the seller. In June 1999 the applicant sued the seller for return of the purchase price, repayment of the loan and interest on the amounts outstanding. On 5 March 2001 the Timiryazevskiy District Court partly accepted the action. The applicant's representative, Mr Martyanov, appealed to the Moscow City Court. He complained that the judgment was unfair and that the District Court had not given the applicant's arguments due consideration. <	[3]	2	2	0

On 28 November 2002 the Mirninskiy District Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic granted the applicant's civil action against the Ministry of Finance and awarded her 127,825 Russian roubles (“RUR”, approximately 4,055 euros). On 25 December 2002 the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic upheld the judgment on appeal. On 18 February 2003 the applicant's representative submitted a writ of execution to the Ministry of Finance. At the time the application was lodged with the Court the judgment remained unenforced. According to the Government, on 25 November 2004 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic, by way of a supervisory review, quashed the judgments of 28 November and 25 December 2002 and dismissed the applicant's claim.

1635	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Warsaw. On 2 December 1998 the applicant lodged with the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a civil action against her former employer in which she requested the annulment of a disciplinary penalty. Subsequently, the applicant was dismissed. In January 1999 she lodged a second claim against her former employer in which she asked for reinstatement. On 25 June 1999 the court decided to join both cases. The hearings to be held on 10 December 1999 and 12 January 2000 were adjourned. Subsequently, hearings were held in September and November 2000. The next hearing was held on 21 December 2001. In 2002 the Warsaw District Court held hearings on 18 March and 7 October. Subsequently, the court held hearings at regular intervals. In 2003 it held in total four hearings. In 2004 eight hearings were held; however, the majority of them were adjourned due to the absence of the defendant	[3]	2	2	0
1636	 The applicant was born in 1912 and lived in Gdynia in Poland. She died in 2002. In 1972 the applicant and her husband transferred the ownership of their house and land to their son – Z.J., and kept a lifetime usufruct interest for themselves. Under the terms of the contract Z.J. was supposed to take care of the applicant and her husband and to provide them with food and medical care. However, he had failed to do so. Moreover, on two occasions criminal proceedings against him, for assault on the applicant, had been discontinued (pursuant to the relevant amnesty law). On 2 February 1985 the applicant sued Z.J. in the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) for damages for his failure to comply with the terms of the contract. On several occasions before 1 May 1993 the applicant modified her claim. On 13 July 1993 the Gdańsk District Court held a hearing and ordered an expert to prepare an opinion. On 16 December 1993 it ordered an additional expert opi	[3]	3	2	0

On 23 February 1989 the applicant filed an action with the Tarnobrzeg District Court in which she sought a court order against third parties requiring them to remove an electricity cable they had installed on her land. Between May and August 1989 three hearings were held. An expert opinion was submitted to the court during that period. As the parties were subsequently invited to settle the case, between 15 November 1990 and 6 May 1991 the proceedings were stayed at their request in order to negotiate a settlement. On 29 June 1991 the Tarnobrzeg District Court delivered a judgment dismissing the applicant’s action. The applicant appealed on 28 August 1991.

On 9 September 1991 the Bratislava 5th District Court (Slovakia) ordered the father to pay child maintenance. On 7 June 1994 the applicant, on behalf of her son, filed a petition with the District Court for the judicial enforcement of the maintenance payments. She claimed that, since August 1993, the father had not been paying the maintenance regularly or in full. On 31 July 1995 the District Court increased the amount of child maintenance payable by the father retroactively, as from 1 January 1994. The judgment became final and binding on 6 December 1995. On 4 March 1996 the District Court forwarded the applicant’s petition for enforcement to the Miskolc District Court (Hungary) under a 1989 treaty between former Czechoslovakia and Hungary. On 29 April 1996 enforcement proceedings were instituted before the Miskolc	[3]	2	2	0
1639	 The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Wieluń, Poland. On 1 September 1994 the applicant’s husband died in a road accident.

1640	 The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Samara. She is a former chief tax inspector. On 27 August 1998 the applicant was committed to stand trial on charges of abuse of position and concerted extortion of a bribe. On 28 October 1998 the Samara Regional Court delivered its judgment. It found the applicant guilty of fraud committed in concert with another person through use of her official position, an offence under Article 159 § 2 (a) and (v) of the Criminal Code. She was sentenced to a fine of 1,000 minimum wages (approximately EUR 5,000) and prohibited from holding any positions in tax authorities for three years. On 17 March 1999 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the conviction on appeal. Counsel for the applicant was present at the hearing. As no ordinary appeal lay against the appeal judgment, counsel for the applicant introduced an application for supervisory review with the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russia	[3]	2	2	0

At the end of 1988 the husband left the applicant and their daughter. On 1 February 1989 the applicant’s husband filed a petition for divorce with the Gniezno District Court. He also sought eviction of the applicant from their matrimonial home. In the course of the proceedings the claimant modified his claims on several occasions. On 9 May 1990 the Gniezno District Court ordered the claimant to pay interim maintenance to the applicant. The amount of interim maintenance was increased in the course of the proceedings on several occasions. On an unspecified later date the applicant requested that judge P.K. withdraw from sitting in the case. On 4 October 1990 the Gniezno District Court granted the applicant’s request. On an unspecified date at the beginning of 1992 the applicant requested that judge M	[3]	2	2	0

According to the applicant, in December 1997 she lodged an action against the electricity supplier, seeking to have her home connected to the electricity supply network and asking for compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On 17 July 1998 the Leninskiy District Court of Penza found for the applicant. That judgment was quashed on appeal on 1 December 1998 and re-examination of the case was ordered. On 15 April 1999 the Leninskiy District Court dismissed the action. The judgment became enforceable on 22 June 1999 when the Penza Regional Court upheld it on appeal. On 28 April 2000 the Presidium of the Penza Regional Court, acting upon the applicant's request, quashed the judgments of 15 April and 22 June 1999, by way of supervisory-review proceedings, and remitted the case for a fresh examination.

1643	 On 3 November 1975 the applicant’s parents requested a court to declare that they had acquired by prescription ownership of a plot of land which had been in their possession for more than 15 years. It appears that they were summoned by the court to identify the successors of the original owners and to indicate their addresses. The participation of these persons in the proceedings was necessary to preclude them from invoking their rights after the matter had been decided upon. As the applicant’s parents had failed to establish the addresses of all the persons potentially concerned, the proceedings were stayed on 31 July 1976. The number of persons potentially affected by the outcome of the proceedings amounted at that time to thirty-eight, some of whom resided abroad. On unspecified dates in 1977 the applicant’s parents died and the applicant and her sister inherited their estate. Between 1975 and 1990, some of the original owners of the property or the	[3]	0	2	0

On 25 April 1987 the Poznań District Court ordered two court files from other proceedings to be joined to the case. On 22 March 1988 the Poznań District Court urged the competent court to submit these files. On 6 April 1988 the above-mentioned order was complied with. On 27 June 1988 the first hearing was held. As witnesses had not been summoned properly, the hearing was adjourned. On 14 September 1989 the second hearing was held. As witnesses had not been called properly the hearing was again adjourned. On 14 November 1989 the third hearing was held at which it was decided to appoint two experts. On 8 March 1990 and 6 April 1992 the experts’ opinions were submitted to the court.

1645	 The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Chişinău. She is an invalid (second degree). The applicant and her family (her husband and three children, two of whom were minors at the relevant time) rented an apartment from the State. In 1994 the apartment was seriously damaged due to leakage from water pipes. Two special commissions of the Chişinău Municipality confirmed the damage to the apartment and found that it was not habitable and was in imminent danger of collapse. The applicant’s requests to be offered alternative accommodation as required by law were rejected by the Municipality due to the lack of available apartments. The applicant and her family continued to live in the apartment until December 2000 when they moved to a rented room. In April 1995 the applicant brought a civil action against the Municipality claiming the right to receive a new apartment. On 10 October 1995 the Chişinău District Court found for the applicant and ordered the Municipality t	[3, 9]	2	2	0

The children were born in 1976, 1977 and 1983 respectively. In 1993 Š. opened a business. In connection with that initiative, on the applicant's request, the Čadca District Court (Okresný súd) dissolved their matrimonial property regime under Article 148 § 2 of the Civil Code. From that year on the applicant and Š never lived together. In 1994 the District Court ordered that Š contribute towards the children's maintenance by making monthly payments. At the same time, it dismissed as premature the parents' respective claims for custody and care of the children. In 1995 the applicant set up a commercial limited liability company (company B) of which she is the sole owner and statutory representative. In 1996 the applicant and Š set up a commercial limited liab	[3]	2	2	0

Between 7 January 1977 and 31 January 1983 the applicant deposited in total 70,140 German marks (DEM) in her savings account at the then State-owned Privredna banka Sarajevo Filijala Banja Luka. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in other successor States of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“SFRY”), such savings are commonly referred to as “old” foreign-currency savings, having been deposited prior to the dissolution of the SFRY. The relevant background information on this subject is set out in detail in the Chamber’s decision on the admissibility of the present application (see Jeličić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 41183/02, ECHR 2005-XII). On 31 December 1991 the balance in the applicant’s account, which included accrued interest, was DEM 235,924 (in the former SFRY, foreign-currency deposits earned high interest).

1648	 At the material time the applicant worked as a journalist for Struma, a local newspaper based in the town of Blagoevgrad, reporting on the work of law‑enforcement agencies and investigating crime‑related news. On 16 December 1996 the term of her contract with the newspaper expired and her employment was terminated. On 19 September 1994 Struma ran an article titled “Camp head counsellor mistreats twenty‑seven children”. In that article, written by the applicant, the manager of a schoolchildren's summer camp, Mr P.Y., was accused of having beaten and ill‑treated the children in his care. On 22 August 1994 Mr P.Y. complained to the Razlog District Prosecutor's Office. The Office conducted a preliminary inquiry in the course of which the applicant was questioned on 12 September 1994.

She has lived since 1950 in a house on the outskirts of Brescia, 30 metres away from a plant for the storage and treatment of “special waste” classified as either hazardous or non-hazardous. A joint-stock company, Ecoservizi, began operating the plant in 1982. In a decision (delibera) of 4 April 1989, the Lombardy Regional Council granted Ecoservizi a licence to operate the plant for a five-year period. The different forms of waste treatment covered by Ecoservizi’s licence included, for the first time, the “detoxification” (inertizzazione) of hazardous waste, a process involving the treatment of special industrial waste using chemicals. On 30 October 1991 the Regional Council authorised Ecoservizi to increase the annual quantity of waste treated at the plant to a total volume of 192,000 cubic metres. In particular, the quantity of toxic waste authorised for detoxification was raised from 30,000 to 7	[4]	3	2	1

On 1 March 1994 a State-owned construction company “Lengidroenergospetsstroy” (промышленное строительно-монтажное объединение «Ленгидроэнергоспецстрой», hereinafter “LenGESS”) and a private investment company “Severo-Zapadniy Soyuz” (АОЗТ ТПК «Северо-Западный Союз», hereinafter “SZS”) signed a contract, pursuant to which the LenGESS undertook to build a block of flats in St. Petersburg and the SZS was to finance the construction in part. By way of consideration, the SZS was to receive title to a certain number of flats in the completed construction. In order to raise funds, the SZS collected money from private investors who were to become the eventual owners of the flats. On 22 July 1994 the applicant signed a contract for the purchase of a flat with the SZS.  Seven days later she paid the stipulated price in full.

Under the terms of the contract, the applicant bought 11,733 chicks from the company which she was to raise for a period of two months. Subsequently, the applicant was to deliver the chickens to the company against a payment of an agreed price. In November and December 1994 the applicant purchased foodstuff from a company in Kętrzyn to feed the birds. Subsequently, about 60% of the chicks died. On 1 March 1995 the applicant filed a compensation claim with the Suwałki Regional Court against the company producing the foodstuff. She asserted that her chicks had died as a result of being fed the foodstuff purchased from the company. The defendant company contested its liability for the damage sustained by the applicant.

The property was nationalised following the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in the 1940s. After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, the applicant’s mother applied for the property to be returned to her in kind, pursuant to the 1991 legislation on restitution of property rights. On 14 March 1996 the Kaunas City Council adopted a decision to pay to the applicant’s mother monetary compensation for the family’s former building situated in Šv.

1700	 The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Berlin. From 1960 to 1979 she worked as a ballet dancer for the Erich-Weinert-Ensemble (EWE), a national company of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). In 1979 she terminated her career on stage and worked for the company as a set and costume designer. The EWE paid the applicant her wages as a costume and set designer and, in addition, a monthly allowance in the amount of 588 GDR marks (hereafter „the allowance“). The allowance was paid by virtue of the regulation of the Minister of Culture (Anordnung über die Gewährung einer berufsbezogenen Zuwendung an Ballettmitglieder in staatlichen Einrichtungen der DDR) of 1 September 1976. Pursuant to this regulation former members of ballets in the GDR were paid an allowance at the end of their career on stage. The allowance accrued after reaching the age of 35 and having worked for at least 15 years as a dancer. It was paid, irrespective of other earnings, by the former employ	[3]	2	2	1
1701	 The applicant was born in 1957 and currently resides in the town of Vasylkiv, Kyiv Region, Ukraine. The applicant and her ex-husband are doctors. They have established several NGOs among which are “Lyubava” and “Rodyna” NGOs. On 15 April 1999 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant's ex-husband allegedly for the misappropriation of humanitarian aid. On the same day, in the course of these criminal proceedings, the applicant was arrested, her apartment and garages were searched and some of the applicant's property was seized. The police also seized some documents of the “Lyubava” NGO. On 16 April 1999 a judge of the Vasylkivskyy Town Court ordered the applicant's detention for three days under the administrative procedure for failure to comply with the orders given to her by the police and the refusal to let the police officers search her apartment.

The applicant lives in Moscow. On 25 December 2000 the applicant applied to the passport department at the “Filevskiy Park” police station in Moscow for residence registration. She produced her USSR passport, a consent form signed by the flat owner and certified by the housing maintenance authority, an application form for residence registration, a document showing payment of housing maintenance charges and an extract from the residents’ list. The Director of the passport department refused to process the application for residence registration.

1703	 The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Moscow.  In January 1995 she was injured in a traffic accident. On 3 July 1998 the applicant lodged an action before the Koptevskiy District Court of Moscow seeking compensation for damage from the owner of the car, a private company. On 8 July 1998 the Koptevskiy District Court adjourned the examination of the action until 20 July 1998 to allow the applicant to indicate possible evidence and clarify her claims. After she had duly fulfilled the instructions, on 20 July 1998 the Koptevskiy District Court asked the Simonovskiy District Court of Moscow and certain hospitals to submit documents related to the traffic accident and the state of the applicant's health. The documents were received on 3 August 1998.

1704	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Istanbul. On 26 November 1999 Ms S.D. lodged a criminal complaint against S.Ç. and G.D., alleging threatening behaviour. She apparently stated that “a certain Erdoğan, chief of police” had protected the two men. On 5 February 2000, at about 5 p.m., the applicant, who had been employed as a doctor by the Istanbul police for fifteen years, received a telephone call from his supervisor, who asked him to come to the office. As he got out of his car in the car park outside the building, the applicant was stopped by three police officers. In front of the members of the public in the courtyard, he was handcuffed and informed that he was under arrest. In the course of his arrest, the applicant told the officers that he was an official police doctor and that there must have been a mistake. He begged them not to handcuff him in front of hundreds of people. He was taken into police custody in the organised crime and arms-traffickin	[1]	2	2	0
1705	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Czeladź. She and her husband married in 1973. Their daughter was born in 1976. It appears that the applicant's husband abused alcohol and subjected her to psychological harassment over a long period of time. In the early 1980s that situation led to the applicant's nervous breakdown. She began receiving neurological treatment. In October 1993 she and her daughter left the matrimonial home. Nonetheless, the applicant's husband continued to harass her. In November 1995 the applicant applied for a divorce order which was granted in March 1996. The divorce court found that the applicant's husband had been at fault in respect of the breakdown of their marriage. In July 1996 the applicant began receiving psychiatric treatment. In January 1997 she was declared to have a “second degree of invalidity” and granted an invalidity pension on account of the state of her mental health. In March 1998 the applicant was declared e	[3]	2	2	0
1706	 In 1994 the applicant married D.M. and in 1995 their daughter S.M. was born. In 1998 the applicant started having marital problems, apparently as a result of her contracting HIV. On 3 July 1998 S.M. left Zemun, a part of Belgrade where she lived with her parents, to stay with her grandparents for a while. In early August of 1998, D.M. brought S.M. back to Zemun. Shortly afterwards, however, the applicant's marriage broke down and D.M. ceased living with the applicant. He also took S.M. to his parents' flat, denying the applicant any contact with her. On 11 February 1999 the applicant filed a claim with the Fourth Municipal Court in Belgrade (“Četvrti opštinski sud u Beogradu”), seeking dissolution of the marriage, sole custody of S.M. and child maintenance. In addition, she requested interim relief, granting her temporary custody or, in the alternative, regular weekly contacts with S.M. until the conclusion of the civil proceedings. </s	[3, 4]	0	2	0
1707	 The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in the town of Zarechniy of the Sverdlovsk Region. In 1984 she married Mr Igor Gavrikov and a year later gave birth to their first son. On 25 May 1995 the applicant formally divorced Mr Gavrikov. She explained that the divorce had been motivated by the desire to improve their housing conditions. As a divorced person she had become eligible for a separate flat which she received. But shortly thereafter they had exchanged the two flats for a larger one and moved in together. In 1996 their second son was born. In the night from 3 to 4 July 2001 Mr Gavrikov died in an aeroplane crash. The plane was owned and operated by the public company “VladivostokAvia” (“the air carrier”). The air carrier offered to pay compensation. However, the applicant was not satisfied with the amount and sued the air carrier in tort, seeking compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and payment of the insurance cover.

1708	 The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Warsaw. Since 1977 the applicant has suffered from severe myopia, the degree of which was established at -0.2 in the left eye and -0.8 in the right eye. Before her pregnancy, she was assessed by a State medical panel, for social-insurance purposes, as suffering from a disability of medium severity. The applicant became pregnant in February 2000. She had previously had two children, both born by Caesarean section. As the applicant was worried about the possible impact of the delivery on her health, she decided to consult her doctors. She was examined by three ophthalmologists (Dr M.S., Dr N.S.-B., Dr K.W.). It transpired from the documents submitted by the applicant that Dr M.S. had recommended that the applicant have frequent check-ups and avoid physical exertion. Dr N.S.-B. stated that the applicant should consider sterilisation after the birth. All of them concluded that, due to pathological changes in the applicant’s 	[4]	2	2	0
1709	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Wrocław. After the applicant's husband had died in September 2002, she instituted proceedings in which she claimed her widow pension. By a decision of 3 October 2002, the social insurance authority dismissed her request. On 4 March 2003 the Wroclaw Regional Court dismissed her appeal against this decision. On 2 September 2004 the Wroclaw Court of Appeal dismissed her further appeal. The appellate court observed that the findings of fact made by the social insurance authority were correct. The applicant and her husband had de facto separated in 1994. He had been living since then with another woman. The applicant had not been receiving any maintenance payments from him. When he had fallen ill, she had not been taking care of him and she had been informed of his poor health only in March 2002.

On 3 February 2000 the Zheleznodorozhnyy District Court of Voronezh granted the applicant's claim and awarded her 1,919.53 Russian roubles. The judgment entered into force on 14 February 2000. Enforcement proceedings were instituted but the judgment was not enforced because the Voronezh Regional administration lacked necessary funds. On 13 February 2006 the judgment of 3 February 2000 was enforced in full.	[3, 9]	2	2	0

On 15 March 1991 the applicant on behalf of the farm entered into a lease purchase option agreement with the State road maintenance company “Saratovavtrodor” (“the road company”) in respect of certain constructions, including a twelve-flat house (“the constructions”). The agreement provided, in particular, that the purchase option was to be exercised upon payment of rent equal to the book value of the property. On 1 July 1993 the lease purchase option agreement was amended: the Property Management Committee of the Saratov Region (“the property committee”) replaced the original lessor as a party to the agreement. The other terms and conditions of the agreement were not affected. On 19 August 1993 the farm credited the required amount to the bank account of the property committee. It t	[3]	3	2	0

In 1995 the applicant became the personal assistant to the College Principal (“the CP”) and from the end of 1995 she was required to work closely with the newly appointed Deputy Principal (“the DP”). In about July 1998, whilst on annual leave, the applicant visited another campus of the College with a male director. She subsequently became aware that the DP had contacted that campus to enquire about her visit and understood that he was suggesting an improper relationship between her and the director. During her employment, the applicant’s telephone, e-mail and Internet usage were subjected to monitoring	[4]	2	2	1
1713	 The applicant, Asmart Magomedovna Baysayeva, was born in 1958 and lives in the village of Pobedinskoye, Grozny district, Chechnya. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant lives in the village of Pobedinskoye in the Grozny district. The applicant's husband, Shakhid Baysayev, born in 1939, worked in the neighbouring village of Podgornoye (also referred to sometimes as Sobachevki) as a mechanic with a municipal transport company. The applicant had been married to her husband for 25 years and had five children. On 2 March 2000 the applicant's husband left for work at about 6.30 a.m. The road to the village of Podgornoye went through a Russian military checkpoint, at that time known as checkpoint no. 53, near which a military unit had been stationed. At about 10 a.m. the same day the applicant heard sounds of shooting and explosions from the road. She went out and saw a convoy of military cars u	[0, 2]	2	2	0
1714	 The applicant was born in October 1971 and lives in Wiltshire. The facts, as found by Mr Justice Wall (“Wall J”), who heard the parties’ oral evidence (see paragraph 20 below), are as follows. On 12 July 2000 the applicant and her partner, J. (born in November 1976), commenced treatment at the Bath Assisted Conception Clinic (“the clinic”). The applicant had been referred for treatment at the clinic five years earlier, when she was married, but had not pursued it because of the breakdown of her marriage. On 10 October 2001 the applicant and J. were informed, during an appointment at the clinic, that preliminary tests had revealed that the applicant had serious pre-cancerous tumours in both ovaries, and that her ovaries would have to be removed. They were told that because the tumours were growing slowly it would be possible first to extract some eggs for in vitro fertilisation (“IVF”), but that this would have to be done quickly.

1715	 The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in London. At the material time, the applicant and her mother, Ms E. Rhodes, lived in Hungary. They ran a shelter for dogs and cats (Csizmás Kandúr Állatotthon és Alapítvány[1]) in the village of Bőny. Apparently in the context of an alleged nuisance caused by the animals, in October 2002 the Győr Police Department initiated an investigation for disorderly conduct (garázdaság) against unknown perpetrators. The Police Department was of the view that there was a well-grounded suspicion against the applicant and her mother. Not knowing their exact names or address and thus unable to summon them, on 15 October 2002 the Police Department commissioned the locally competent police officer (bőnyi körzeti megbízott), P.Z.H., to establish data about the applicant and her mother and to escort them to the Győr Police Department. Because of the office he held in the village, P.Z.H. had previously been introduced to the applican	[1]	2	2	0

On 26 July 2000 the Kamyshin Town Court of the Volgograd Region (“the Kamyshin Town Court”) allowed the applicant's civil claim for defamation against the Prosecutor's Office of the Volgograd Region and awarded her 300 Russian roubles (“RUR”). The award was payable by the Treasury of the Russian Federation. The judgment was not appealed against and became enforceable on 7 August 2000. On 28 August 2000 the applicant submitted a writ of execution to the bailiffs' service. On 30 August 2000 the bailiffs' service returned the writ of execution to the court because it did not have the debtor's address. It asked the court to re-submit a corrected version within ten days. On 10 September 2000 the bailiffs' service discontinued the enforcement proceedings because the writ of execution had not been re-submitted.

On 11 July 2003 the Neryungri Town Court accepted the applicant's claim against the Government of the Russian Federation and awarded her 72,967 Russian roubles (RUR, approximately 2,110 euros) in compensation for a special-purpose settlement order by the terms of which the Government was to provide her with a car in exchange for payments extracted from the applicant's salary and benefits related to her employment in the Far-Northern Region of Russia. The judgment was upheld on appeal on 25 August 2003 by the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic. The Neryungri Town Court issued the applicant with a writ of execution which she submitted to the Ministry of Finance in November 2003.

1718	 On 7 August 2000 a mother contacted the police on account of a suspicion that her children, a girl born in 1991 and a boy born in 1993, had been sexually abused by a neighbour, the applicant. On 10 August and 2 September 2000 the siblings were interviewed by a police officer experienced in investigating sexual abuse of children. The applicant was also suspected of having abused two other girls, both friends of the siblings and born in 1991. The girls were interviewed by the police on 11 August and 18 August respectively and again on 3 September 2000. All the interviews were recorded on videotape. At the time of the first interviews, i.e. on the morning of 10 August 2000, the applicant had not been informed of the suspicions against him and no defence counsel had yet been appointed for him. Neither the applicant nor his counsel was present during the later interviews. The siblings and one of the other girls underwent a psychological examination in the Family Advice Centre w	[3]	1	2	1
1719	 The applicant and another person were suspected of having sexually abused the applicant's two daughters, K. born in October 1986 and J. born in October 1990.

Subsequently, they were questioned again and the interviews were recorded on videotape. K. was interviewed on 15 June and 6 December 1998 and J. on 22 June and 7 December 1998. On 3 December 1998 at the pre-trial stage, the applicant was shown the videotapes. She contested the suspected sexual abuse. She was given an opportunity to have questions put to the children, but she did not avail herself of the opportunity. Her counsel was also present. In her closing statement of 4 February 1999 she maintained that she was not guilty of any offence. She also considered the children's statements contradictory and unclear.

On 9 December 1987 the applicant was operated at the lymphatic gland by doctor M. In the course of that operation, her cranial nerve was damaged. As a consequence, she could no longer properly move her head and shoulders and suffered from considerable pain and a loss of sensibility of her neck and her right arm and hand. Because of this, the applicant became partially unfit for work in her former job as a cleaning lady. She has not been working since her operation and has been living on social security benefits. On 30 March 1989 the applicant, following a suggestion of the defendant's medical malpractice insurance company, had recourse to the arbitration board of the Rhineland-Palatinate Medical Council (Landesärztekammer).

1721	 The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Gerasdorf. The application concerns land consolidation proceedings involving land belonging to some 500 owners, including the applicant's husband. In 1986 a valuation schedule (Bewertungsplan) was issued, which became final in October of that year. None of the plots of land belonging to the applicant's husband was considered to be of special value. By decision of 13 November 1986 the provisional transfer of land (vorläufige Übernahme) was ordered. In 1990 the Regional Land Reform Board (Landesargarsenat) issued a consolidation plan (Zusammenlegungsplan) for the Gerasdorf community. The applicant's husband did not appeal, while a number of other parties did. Some of these appeals were successful and the case was remitted to the Regional Land Reform Board.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On the evening of 11 August 1990, following a period of increased hostility between the Roma and non-Roma inhabitants of Caşinul Nou, and amid accusations that local Roma had been stealing, between approximately 60 and 400 non-Roma villagers gathered in front of the village church and planned to chase out the entire Roma population. Subsequently, they burned and otherwise destroyed several houses and other property, including the applicant's house and its entire contents. As a consequence, approximately 150 persons were left homeless, while many others, including the applicant and her four young children, faced the threat of being lynched.

In 1989 her husband and son, Mr B.P. and Mr B.I., became members of the Cooperative Society for Construction and Repair “Kooperator” (the “Society”). On 22 May 1990 the Ternopil Town Executive Committee (the “Committee”) transferred two plots of land in Ternopil to the Society for the construction of three houses. By decision of 14 November 1990, the Committee transferred a part of that land to the applicant's husband and son for the erection of a two-flat house.

The Drogobych Court (Дрогобичський міський суд Львівської області) decided to examine the two complaints jointly and held some three hearings before September 1997. No procedural actions are reported to have taken place between September 1997 and December 2000. <	[3]	3	2	0
1788	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Odessa. In October 1993 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Malynivsky District Court of Odessa (“the Malynivsky Court,” Малинівський районний суд м. Одеса) against Ms T. V., her sister, seeking to divide their house and adjacent land. Subsequently the proceedings were transferred to the Kyivsky District Court of Odessa (“the Kyivsky Court,” Київський районний суд м. Одеса). Between 1993 and 2000 some six expert assessments were carried out to develop proposals for dividing the house and the land. On 12 December 2000 the Kyivsky Court rejected the applicant's claims. The court found that it was not possible to divide the property to the satisfaction of the parties. This decision became final. On 6 June 2001 the Presidium of the Odessa Regional Court (“the Regional Court”)[1] quashed this judgment, following a supervisory protest, lodged by its Deputy President, and remitted the case for a 	[3]	2	2	0
1789	 The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Celje. On 2 July 1995 the applicant was injured in a car accident. She had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT. The applicant and ZT agreed on the appointment of a medical expert to assess the extent of the applicant's injuries. The appointed medical expert established that the applicant had sustained 45 per cent permanent invalidity as a result of the accident. ZT paid the applicant damages corresponding to 35 per cent of the invalidity level. On 13 October 1998 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje Local Court (Okrajno sodišče v Celju) seeking payment of damages corresponding to the unpaid 10 per cent of the invalidity level in the amount of 677,040 Slovenian tolars (approximately 2,800 euros). Between 20 October 1999 and 30 August 2002 the applicant lodged four preliminary written submissions. On 20 October 1999 she also made a request that a date be set for a hearin	[3]	2	2	0
1790	 The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Lisburn, Northern Ireland. On 19 May 2000 the applicant’s husband was murdered. On 18 August 2001 the applicant was charged with aiding and abetting Mr G, her former lover, to murder her husband. She was released on bail pending trial to her home where she lived with her three children, who were 6 years of age at the time (triplets). Neither the police nor the prosecution objected. The trial judge permitted the applicant to remain on bail throughout the trial: no objection was formulated by the prosecution. She continued to reside at home with her children. On 20 November 2002 the jury unanimously convicted Mr G of murder but failed to agree on a verdict on the applicant. The trial judge granted her bail pending the prosecution’s decision whether to prosecute her further. The prosecution did not object to bail and she remained at home with her children. Subsequently, the prosecution elected to prosecute the applicant aga	[2]	2	2	1
1791	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in the town of Sukhodolsk, Lugansk region. On 31 March 1997 the Krasnodon Court awarded the applicant's husband UAH 27,669 from his former employer, the State Mining Company “Duvannaya”, in compensation for health damage inflicted by a work accident. In May 1998 the applicant's husband died. On 27 June 2000 the Presidium of the Lugansk Regional Court, upon the prosecutor's protest lodged under the extraordinary review procedure, quashed the judgment of 31 March 1997 and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. The outcome of these proceedings is unknown. On 21 August 2000 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Krasnodon Court against the State Mining Company “Duvannaya” claiming compensation for health damage allegedly due to her late husband. Between September 2000 and November 2001 seven out of nineteen hearings were adjourned due to the respondent's representative failure to appear bef	[3]	2	2	0
1792	 The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Armagh. She is the widow of Trevor Brecknell. On 19 December 1975, loyalist gunmen arrived at Donnelly’s Bar, Silverbridge, in County Armagh and fired a machine gun at persons outside the bar. Two men entered the bar. One sprayed the room with automatic gunfire and the other threw a bomb into the premises. Trevor Brecknell, Patrick Donnelly and Michael Donnelly (aged 14) were killed and six other people received serious injuries. The applicant was at the time in hospital following the birth of her daughter and was informed of her husband’s death by the hospital chaplain and her doctor. The emergency services and the police were alerted to the incident within a short time. While the dead and injured were being removed from the scene, soldiers of the Royal Scots Regiment were stoned upon their arrival and had to withdraw. As a consequence of the hostile reception, police decided not to investigate the scene until first lig	[0]	3	2	1
1793	 The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Budapest. On 5 April 1988 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and her alleged accomplices. On 20 August 1990 the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office preferred a bill of indictment charging them with larceny. Subsequently, the Pest Central District Court held five hearings. Between 15 March 1993 and 30 September 1994 the applicant was not available for trial. Subsequently the District Court held seven hearings. In the period between 26 August 1998 and 13 August 1999, the applicant was again unavailable for trial. From 5 May 2000 until 5 March 2003, the Pest Central District Court held seven hearings. On 21 May 2003 the court ordered the applicant's examination by an expert psychiatrist. Since the applicant did not comply voluntarily, it could not take place before 21 November 2003. On 31 March 2004 the applicant was acquitted.	[3]	2	2	0
1794	 The applicant was born in 1923 and lives in Whitecross, County Armagh. She was the mother of John Reavey, Brian Reavey and Anthony Reavey. On the evening of 4 January 1976, John Reavey, Brian Reavey and Anthony Reavey, sons of the applicant, were at home watching television. Between 6.05-6.10 p.m., three gunmen entered the house and shot all three brothers. Brian was shot three times in the back and once in the legs; John was hit by 14-16 9mm bullets in the neck and body: the autopsy report concluded that death would have been rapid in both cases. Anthony was hit six times in the legs. When the gunmen had gone, Anthony made his way to a neighbour's house to give the alarm. He later died of a brain haemorrhage in hospital on 30 January 1976, the autopsy report concluding that the wounds that he had received had played no part in his death. On the same night, three other Catholics, Barry O'Dowd, Declan O'Dowd and Joseph O'Dowd were shot and killed in County Down, ab	[0]	3	2	1
1795	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Amsterdam. In 1967 her parents built a holiday home without planning permission on land situated in Zutendaal (Belgium). According to the applicant, however, the house was built in 1962. Following her mother’s death, a deed of partition was drawn up on 6 January 1986 between the applicant (who, inheriting from her mother, became the remainderman of half of the property) and her father. That deed, which specifically mentions the existence of the building, was registered with the Mortgage Registrar at the Ministry of Finance and a registration fee was paid. The applicant’s father died on 21 August 1993 and she became the full and sole owner of the entire property. On inheriting the property, the applicant specifically declared in the notarised deed of distribution that the plot was a holiday home. The deeds were registered with the local authorities and the applicant paid the inheritance tax. From then on, the app	[3]	2	2	1
1796	 The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Kraków. On 10 June 1997 the Mayor of the City of Kraków (Prezydent Miasta Krakowa) issued a building permit to the applicant's neighbour. The applicant appealed, submitting that, according to the construction project, the proposed building would encroach on her land. She also requested that the construction work be stopped. On 22 August 1997 the Kraków City Office instituted administrative demarcation proceedings at the applicant's request in order to establish a boundary between the two properties. On 28 July 1997 the Governor of the Kraków Region (Wojewoda Krakowski) upheld the decision of 10 June 1997. On 28 August 1997 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. On 5 September 1997 the Construction Supervision Department of the Kraków City Office (Wydział Nadzoru Budowlanego Miasta Krakowa) conducted an inspection on the applicant's neighbour's building site. On 12 December 	[3]	3	2	0
1797	 The applicant was born in 1915 and lives in Nyíregyháza. On 12 January 1996 the applicant brought an action against her neighbours with a view to terminating their common ownership of a house. After having held several hearings and obtained the opinion of an expert, on 25 November 1996 the Nyíregyháza District Court dismissed the action, holding that no physical division was possible, whereas a buyout or the auctioning of the house would cause the respondents disproportionate damage. On 17 September 1997 the Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal. On 13 May 1998 the Supreme Court quashed this decision and remitted the case to the second-instance court. In the resumed proceedings, on 29 August 2000 the Regional Court ordered the respondents to buy out the applicant's share of property. On 26 February 2003 the Supreme Court upheld this decision. Its judgment was served on the applicant on 17	[3]	3	2	0
1798	 The applicant was born in 1958 and was a resident of Grozny, Chechnya. She currently resides in Ingushetia. The submissions of the parties on the facts concerning the circumstances of the applicant’s relatives’ deaths and the ensuing investigation are set out in Part A below. A description of the relevant materials submitted to the Court is contained in Part B. The applicant and her family lived in the Staropromyslovskiy district of Grozny in their own house at 166 Derzhavina Street. In October 1999 hostilities resumed in Chechnya between the Russian forces and the Chechen fighters. Grozny and its suburbs came under heavy bombardment. The Staropromyslovskiy district, situated in the northern and central parts of the town, was bombarded from the air and by artillery. The applicant submitted that most residents of the district had left for safer areas. Following heavy fighting, as of December 1999 the Russian forces started to regain control over the city s	[0]	2	2	0
1799	 The applicant was born in 1926 and lives in Ankara. On 23 January 1975 the applicant bought part of a plot of land (plot no. 98) in the Çankaya District of Ankara. In implementation of a reconstruction plan (imar şuyulandırılması), on 21 January 1981 a part of the applicant's plot (173.92 sq. m.) was joined to another plot which had been used by the Ministry of Defence since 1962. This plot was given the number 5965/1 and registered in the applicant's name. Since this land was occupied by the Ministry of Defence, the applicant filed various petitions requesting the Ministry to expropriate it. On 6 September 1989 the Ministry informed the applicant that her land would be expropriated in the coming years. On 10 November 1999, relying on Article 38 of Law no. 2942, the Ministry of Defence lodged an application with the Ankara Civil Court of General Jurisdiction for the annulment of the title deed of the applicant to plot no. 5965/1 and its registration in th	[9]	3	2	0
1800	 The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Voronezh. From June 1998 to April 1999 she received her old-age pension several months in arrears. The applicant lodged an action against the Levoberezhniy District Social Security Authority of Voronezh for index-linking of her delayed pension payments in line with inflation. On 24 November 2000 the Levoberezhniy District Court of Voronezh granted the applicant's claim and awarded her 1,101.02 Russian roubles. The judgment came into force on 5 December 2000. The applicant's requests for execution of the judgment were to no avail on the ground that the defendant did not have funds. The judgment was enforced on 2 December 2005.	[3, 9]	3	2	0
1801	 The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in Marmaris. In 1984 the applicant concluded a construction contract with Mr G.D. whereby the applicant was to own 40 % of the flats constructed by Mr G.D. on her land. On 10 July 1985 Mr G.D. and the applicant's legal representative signed an additional contract and decided to sell the flats to Emlak Bank. Subsequently on 29 January 1986 the applicant filed an action with the Ankara Civil Court of First Instance against Mr G.D. She maintained that her legal representative had no right to sign such a contract and accordingly requested the annulment of the contract dated 10 July 1985 and the reimbursement of 132,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL). On 31 May 1990 the 5th Chamber Ankara Civil Court of First Instance dismissed the case. This judgment was upheld by the Court of Cassation on 19 June 1991. However, upon the request of the applicant, on 26 December 1991 the Court of Cassation rectified its decision of 19 June 199	[3]	3	2	0
1802	 The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in the town of Makhachkala. The applicant married in 1990. The applicant and her husband were nominal but non-practising Muslims at that time. Two children, a boy and a girl, were born to the couple in 1993 and 1997 respectively. It appears that the family lived at a house of the paternal grandparents in the village of Novomugri, Sergokalinskiy District of the Republic of Dagestan. Being upset with various difficulties in the relations with her husband who was a seaman and frequently away at sea, in June 1999 the applicant started associating with the Jehovah's Witnesses. In June 2000 the mounting tensions between the spouses over the applicant's religious interests resulted in the applicant's decision to leave the matrimonial home together with the children. The applicant and children started living with the maternal grandparents. In December 2000 the applicant was baptised as a Jehov	[]	1	2	0
1803	 The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Kharkiv. On 5 May 2000 the Dzerzhynskiy District Court of Kharkiv (Дзержинський районний суд м. Харкова) awarded the applicant 4,489.02 hryvnyas (UAH)[1] against her former employer, the Frunzenskiy District Municipal Renovation Company (Державне комунальне ремонтно-будівельне підприємство з ремонту житлового фонду Фрунзенського району м. Харкова) in salary arrears and other payments. This judgment was not appealed against, became final, and the enforcement proceedings were instituted to collect the judgment debt. On 16 June 2000 the Kharkiv City Council (Харківська міська рада) ordered liquidation of the debtor-company and on 22 September 2000 the enforcement writ was transferred to the liquidation commission. On various occasions the applicant complained to the State authorities about the failure of the debtor-company to pay her the judgment debt and was informed that the collection of the debt was no	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1804	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Kemerovo. She was employed by a State enterprise FGUP PO «Progress» (Федеральное государственное унитарное предприятие ПО “Прогресс”). In 1970 she sustained a work-related injury resulting in the loss of her right hand, and became disabled. She became entitled to a disability allowance payable by the employer. As no payments ensued, the applicant brought proceedings for arrears. On 13 February, 5 August 1998 and 9 February 1999 the Kirovskiy District Court of Kemerovo awarded the applicant 26,510; 7,193 and 13,696 Russian roubles (RUB), respectively. It appears that partial payments in execution of those judgments were made between 1998 and 2002. The respective enforcement proceedings were terminated on 31 January, 24 May 2001 and 21 February 2002. By judgment of 15 November 2000, the District Court awarded the applicant RUB 20,279. The Kemerovo Regional Court upheld the judgment on 19 December 2000. On 11 Septe	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1805	 The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Novovoronezh in the Voronezh Region. In 2003 and 2004 the applicant sued the local Social Security Committee for unpaid allowances and commodity benefits.

On 2 September 2003 the judgment became final. The applicant received the monies on 8 June 2005. By judgment of 27 February 2004, the Town Court awarded the applicant RUB 16,765.50 for the period between 1 July and 31 December 2003. On 9 March 2004 the judgment entered into force. The applicant received the monies on 3 August 2005. On 15 March 2004 the Town Court awarded the applicant RUB 4,973.57. It appears that the judgment was not enforced. On 7 May 2004 the Town Court awarded the applicant RUB 9,494.54 for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2004 and increased her mo	[3, 9]	3	2	0
1806	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Adana. In 1995 the applicant's daughter joined the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party), an illegal organisation. The applicant alleges that, since then, the police have raided her house and harassed and threatened her many times. The applicant claims that on 19 November 1999, around midnight, three persons who introduced themselves as police officers from the anti‑terrorism branch of the Adana Security Directorate had entered her house, stuffed her scarf in her mouth and beaten, threatened and sexually harassed her. She alleges that the officers had finally raped her by inserting a truncheon in her vagina and that she had passed out following the rape. On 22 November 1999 the applicant went to the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey (hereinafter “the foundation”) where she gave a description of the ill-treatment she had received at the hands of the police officers and complained in particular of pain in the genital	[1]	2	2	0
1807	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Ankara. On 12 December 2000 an unauthorised demonstration in Kızılay, Ankara against F‑Type prisons turned into a violent clash between some of the participants, a group of Turkish nationalists and the security forces. The demonstrators caused severe material damage to cars and a shop, and eight police officers were injured during the incident. The applicant claims that she had been on her way to her sister's law office when she saw armoured police vehicles firing high pressure water jets and a group of people throwing stones at others in the vicinity. She had had to enter the ÖDP (Liberty and Solidarity Party) building in order to protect herself from the police and the demonstrators. After a while, police officers, who had previously obtained a search warrant, entered the ÖDP building and arrested around fifty persons who were inside at the time, including the applicant. During the arrest, the applicant claims	[1]	1	2	0
1808	 The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in the town of Saransk in the Mordoviya Republic. In 1990 the applicant obtained a State special-purpose commodity bond (облигация государственного целевого беспроцентного займа). By its terms the Government undertook to give her a Russian-made VAZ passenger car. It appears that in 1993 the applicant requested the State to comply with its obligation, but it could not be fulfilled for want of cars. After the change in legislation in 1995 and 1996, the applicant became entitled to compensation in the amount equal to the car value, as described in the bond and determined in co-ordination with car manufacturers at the moment of redemption. It appears that in August 1998 the applicant received partial compensation. In November 1999 she sued the Government for the full market value of the car. By judgment of 25 April 2002, the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Saransk awarded her 50,400 Russian ro	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1809	 The applicant was born in 1926 and lives in Korolev, a town in the Moscow Region. In 1990 the applicant underwent surgery on her right hand in a local hospital. The applicant alleges that the operation was unsuccessful because of the negligence of the medical personnel, with the result that her ability to move her right hand was impaired. On 24 April 1994 the applicant brought proceedings against the hospital, seeking compensation for harm inflicted on her as a result of medical negligence. Following an order of the court, on 10 April 1995 the applicant underwent a forensic medical examination at the Forensic Examination Bureau of the Moscow City Health Department (“the Bureau”). On 14 December 1995 the Koptevskiy District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”) dismissed the applicant's civil action as unfounded.

In 1950, the real estate made up of two apartments and the appurtenant land situated in Bucharest, Regina Maria blvd. nos. 36-38, the property of the applicant's parents, was seized by the State under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation. The applicant continued to live in a flat situated in building no. 38 as a tenant of the State. On 15 January 1996 the applicant claimed restitutio in integrum of building no. 38 and compensation for building no. 36. On 15 June 2000, the Bucharest Town Council rejected her demand. The applicant contested the decision before the courts. On 2 March 2001, the Bucharest District Court upheld the applicant's action by a final judgment, declaring void the decision of the Town Council and ordering the administrative authorities to return to the applicant the real estate no. 38, made of three buildings and appurtenant land of 208 m².

On 14 September 1995 the applicant brought an action against her former husband in the Trnava District Court (Okresný súd) seeking the division and distribution of their matrimonial property. She submitted that following their divorce in 1993 the defendant had taken possession of all their property and that she had been forced to leave their household and was living in a sub-leased flat. Between 1996 and 2002 the District Court held 7 hearings. The action was assigned, in turn, to 4 different judges. On 30 October 2002 the District Court appointed an expert to draw up a report on the property to be divided. On 20 December 2002 the applicant raised objections as to the expert’s qualifications. The District Court dismissed them and ruled on the expert’s fees on 5 and 17 February 2003, respectively. The decision of 5 February 2003 was upheld on the applicant’s appeal on 31 July 2003.

Her biological mother abandoned her outside the house of a woman who gave her to Mrs Maria Phinikaridou. The latter brought her up. Although estranged from her biological mother, the applicant did not lose all contact with her. In December 1997, when the applicant was fifty-two years old, her biological mother, just before dying, told her the name of her biological father in the presence of the applicant's son. Her mother died in January 1998. On 24 June 1999 the applicant lodged an application with the Nicosia Family Court requesting judicial recognition of paternity on the basis of section 20(2) of the Children (Relatives and Legal Status) Law 1991 (hereinafter “the Children Law”).

They have eight children. The applicant submits that her husband was a member of HADEP (People's Democracy Party) at the material time. In 1995 the Diyarbakır State Security Court tried and acquitted Mehmet Özdemir of the charges of aiding and abetting an illegal armed organisation, namely the PKK (The Kurdistan Workers' Party). On 5 August 1997 Mehmet Özdemir was arrested and taken into police custody where he remained until he was released pending trial on 9 August 1997. Criminal proceedings were initiated against him on the ground that he was aiding and abetting an illegal armed organisation.

1816	 On 9 December 1996 the applicant filed a petition to be divorced from the child’s father. In February 1997 she requested to be granted sole parental authority. On 19 June 1997, during a hearing before the Pankow-Weissensee District Court (Amtsgericht) in proceedings relating to divorce and parental authority, both parents declared their consent to the child’s temporary placement in a foster family. This measure was originally planned for a short period of time during which a court-appointed expert was to prepare his opinion on custody rights and aimed at preventing the child’s welfare being jeopardised by serious tensions arising from her parents’ divorce proceedings. According to the applicant’s submissions, which are contested by the Government, she gave her consent only under the threat that the child would otherwise be permanently placed in a children’s home. On 25 June 1997 S. was placed in the care of a foster family. According to the applicant’s submissions	[]	0	2	1

1818	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Cahul. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant worked for a State-owned theatre in Cahul (Teatrul Republican Muzical-Dramatic 'B.P. Haşdeu', “the employer”). On 22 October 1996 she was dismissed and initiated court proceedings to have that dismissal annulled. On 5 February 1997 the Cahul District Court ordered her re-instatement.

1850	 The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Moscow. The applicant was a party to a civil dispute with her former husband over a flat which they occupied under a tenancy agreement. The Nagatinskiy District Court of Moscow twice rendered judgments unfavourable to the applicant but the Moscow City Court quashed them on appeals and remitted the case for fresh examinations. The new hearing of the case was set for 14 May 2002. The Nagatinskiy District Court was composed of Ms F. (presiding judge), Ms B. and Mr S. (lay assessors). Prior to that, on 6 March 2001 in accordance with Section 5 of the Lay Assessors Act the acting President of the Nagatinskiy District Court of Moscow assigned the above two lay assessors to sit with judge F. Before the court started to examine the claims, the applicant challenged the composition of the bench.

At the material time the applicant and her family lived in Grozny, in a private household comprising two houses at 76 Voronezhskaya Street. On 12 May 2001 the applicant’s son Isa Kaplanov, born in 1965, his wife, Melina Mezhidova, the applicant’s son-in-law, Ruslan Sadulayev, born in 1962, her daughter Lidia Kaplanova and their neighbour Movsar Musitov (also spelled Musaitov), who had come to visit them, were at home. The applicant was away and therefore her account of the events of that date was based on eyewitness statements of her family members. At about 10.00 a.m. a group of approximately 20 federal servicemen arrived at the applicant’s household in six armoured personnel carriers (APCs). The identification number of one of the vehicles was 40-42, whilst the other carriers had no such numbers on them. The servicemen in camouflage uniforms were armed with AK-47 mac	[0, 2]	3	2	0

1854	 The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Kyiv. Between 1991 and September 1997 the applicant and her minor son born in 1984 were officially registered as residents in a municipal hostel rented by the Municipal Post Office, the applicant’s employer, for its employees. Throughout this period, the Post Office, in fact, never provided the applicant with a room in this hostel, citing lack of available premises. The applicant and her son were allowed to occupy two beds in a hostel for single individuals managed by “D.H.”, another company. After the expiration of the residency registration, in October 1997 the applicant found an unoccupied room in the Post Office’s hostel and moved there with her son. On 28 November 1997 the Post Office brought eviction proceedings against the applicant (and her minor son) before the Starokyivsky District Court of Kyiv (Старокиївський районний суд м. Києва).

She was seriously ill and was admitted to hospital, where she was diagnosed as HIV-positive with “considerable immunosuppression and ... disseminated mycobacterium TB”. On 31 March 1998 solicitors lodged an asylum application on her behalf, claiming that she had been ill-treated and raped by the National Resistance Movement in Uganda because of her association with the Lord’s Resistance Army, and asserting that she was in fear of her life and safety if she were returned. In August 1998 the applicant developed a second Aids-defining illness, Kaposi’s sarcoma. Her CD4 count was down to 10 (that of a healthy person is over 500).

1858	 The applicant, Ms Marianna Cieślak, is a Polish national who was born in 1923 and lives in Bobolice. The applicant’s mother-in-law died on 6 October 1975. During the proceedings for division of inheritance, on 30 October 1980 the Mayor of Warsaw’s Wola District (Naczelnik Dzielnicy Warszawa Wola – hereafter, “the Mayor”) expropriated part of the land belonging to the applicant’s family. On 22 February 1981 the applicant’s husband inherited the plot of land in Warsaw. On 17 August 1988, after his death, the applicant became the co-owner of the land. The applicant instituted proceedings for annulment of the Mayor’s decision. On 22 March 1991 the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny) decided that the expropriation decision had been taken in flagrant infringement of the law. On 29 February 1996 the Warsaw Governor’s Office (Urząd Wojewódzki) quashed the Mayor’s decision and dismissed an application by the Polish Allotment Associa	[3]	3	2	0
1859	 The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Lustenau. Her father is an Austrian national of Turkish origin. In February 1998 she entered Austria on a temporary visa, valid until 30 June 1998.

Subsequently, on 11 February 1999, she filed an objection (Einspruch) against that decision with the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority. On 22 March 1999 the applicant, upon the District Administrative Authority’s request, filed a statement in which she specified that she had entered Austria with a valid visa on 26 February 1998. As proceedings for a residence permit were underway, she was in her view allowed to stay until the decision had 	[3]	1	2	1

1861	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Savona, Italy. On 19 January 1998 the applicant entered Romania with a tourist visa valid until 2 February 1998 and started business activities. In February 1998, when the applicant requested extension of the visa, the authorities asked for proof of residence in Romania that she could not provide. In February-March 1999 the authorities refused the applicant’s request for extension of her visa as out of time. They told her that she needed to “know people” who could help her receive a new visa. On 29 April 2000 the applicant was questioned by two officers from the Bucharest police to whom she claims she gave a bribe of 100,000 Old Romanian Lei (ROL) to let her go. On 4 May 2000 at 8.30 a.m. the applicant was again stopped by officers from the Bucharest police when she was on her way to the Italian consulate.

She was told that on 24 September 2006 the Belarus authorities had placed her name on the list of fugitives from justice, suspecting her of involvement in human trafficking. The applicant was taken to the Domodedovo transport police department. No arrest record was compiled. On 21 February 2007 counsel for the applicant complained to the transport prosecutor's office about the absence of an arrest record and failure to provide the applicant with food, drink and access to a toilet. It is unclear whether any response was received. On 27 February 2007 the first deputy head of the central police station of Minsk faxed a letter to the head of the Domodedovo transport police department, asking him to keep the applicant in custody.

On 24 November 1998 the court rejected the applicant’s reinstatement claim, but awarded her 438.95 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in salary arrears. On 4 March 1999 the Lugansk Regional Court (Луганський обласний суд)[1] upheld the judgment to the extent that the applicant was awarded salary arrears, and the judgment in this respect became final.

1865	 The applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Novosibirsk. She receives an old-age pension. On 1 February 1998 the Law on Calculation and Adjustment of State Pensions (hereafter “the Pensions Act”) introduced a new method of calculation of retirement benefits based on what is known as the “individual pensioner coefficient” (“the IPC”). The IPC was the ratio between an individual’s wages at the time of retirement and the national average wage. The IPC was meant to maintain a link between pensions and previous earnings. The applicant considered that the Zayeltsovskiy District Division of the Pension Fund (hereafter “the Fund”) had incorrectly calculated her pension and in March 1999 she sued the Fund for an increase of her pension in accordance with the Pensions Act. On 11 August 1999 the Zayeltsovskiy District Court of Novosibirsk found in the applicant’s favour.

The applicant had been receiving an old age pension until her departure to take up permanent residence in Israel in December 1997. Before her departure, she was paid, at her written request, six months’ pension in advance prior to the termination of such payments in accordance with section 92 of the Pensions Act. In January 1999 the applicant and her husband wrote a letter to the Pension Fund of Ukraine requesting the resumption of their pension payments. In a letter of 15 March 1999, the Pension Fund informed them that under section 92 of the Pensions Act an old-age pension was not paid to citizens residing permanently abroad and there were no legal grounds for resuming payment of their pensions.

1868	 The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Vilnius, where she formerly worked as a judge. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 10 June 1998 the applicant was approached by SŠ, an acquaintance, with whom, she alleged, she had merely discussed the sale of her car. Unbeknownst to her, their conversation during that meeting was secretly recorded by SŠ. On 16 June 1998 a special anti-corruption police unit of the Ministry of the Interior (Specialiųjų tyrimų tarnyba, hereafter referred to as the STT) received a complaint by SŠ that the applicant had demanded a payoff, in the form of a new car, in return for admitting and deciding SŠ’s civil claim to declare null and void the auction of his property.

At the material time she was living alone in her family house in the village of Ayia Triada, Yialloussa, in the Karpas region of northern Cyprus. She was a teacher at the Greek-Cypriot elementary school in that village. The parties disagree as to the facts of the case. In December 1994 the applicant went to spend the Christmas holidays with members of her family in southern Cyprus. On 13 January 1995 she was transported by a Red Cross bus with other “enclaved” Greek-Cypriots to the Ledra Palace crossing point in Nicosia. From there they were due to be taken to Ayia Triada by a bus driven by a Turkish settler.

This application remained unanswered. In 1981 the Bydgoszcz District Court declared that the applicant had acquired one-half of the estate of her late father and had thereby become his legal successor. On 20 December 1988 the applicant reiterated her father’s request submitted in 1948 and requested that possession of the plot be restored to her. In 1990 she again requested the authorities to issue a decision. In 1993 the Board of Association of Districts of Warsaw City (Zarząd Związku Dzielnic-Gmin Warszawy), by a decision of 17 June, declared that ownership of the property concerned had been acquired by the City of Warsaw Taxi Enterprise.

On 14 September 1993 the applicant made an application to the City Council for a ban on the operation of the workshop or at least for measures to be taken to reduce the level of noise it generated. On 11 June 1994 the Director of the Pabianice District Office, to which the application of 14 September 1993 must have been transferred, issued a decision in which it found that the workshop was operating without the required permission. He obliged the owner of the workshop to take steps to remedy the situation, inter alia by obtaining an environmental impact assessment of the workshop and by carrying out adaptation works.

In his claim, the plaintiff maintained that the applicant had lost “the status of a protected tenant” (nosilac stanarskog prava odnosno zakupac stana na neodređeno vreme), as provided for under the relevant domestic legislation. On 4 April 1994 the First Municipal Court ruled in favour of the applicant. On 20 October 1994 the District Court (Okružni sud) in Belgrade quashed this judgment in view of the unlawful composition of the trial chamber at first instance and sent the case back for a retrial.

The demonstration took place on the Mashtots Avenue next to the Research Institute of Ancient Manuscripts (Մատենադարան). It appears that the demonstration was of a political nature and criticism of the Government and of the conduct of the presidential election was voiced.

1876	 The applicant was born in 1960. Between 1989 and 1994 the applicant worked on fixed-term contracts as a nurse in the polyclinic for eye diseases in a public hospital. From 1987 she paid regular visits to the polyclinic for infectious diseases of the same hospital, having been diagnosed as HIV-positive. Early in 1992 the applicant began to suspect that her colleagues were aware of her illness. At that time hospital staff had free access to the patient register which contained information on patients’ diagnoses and treating doctors. Having confided her suspicions to her doctor in summer 1992, the hospital’s register was amended so that henceforth only the treating clinic’s personnel had access to its patients’ records. The applicant was registered in the patient register under a false name. Apparently later her identity was changed once again and she was given a new social security number. In 1995 the applicant changed her job as her temporary contract was 	[4]	2	2	1

In her application form the applicant submitted that on 18 February 1999, upon a complaint of Mr M.A.G., gendarmes had taken her to the Görükle gendarmerie station where she was beaten with a truncheon and sworn at by a gendarme. According to the report drafted by the gendarmes and signed by the applicant, upon the complaint of Mr M.A.G., that she was, inter alia, throwing garbage from her balcony and swearing at him, the gendarmes had arrived at the scene of the incident where they found the applicant to be shouting and disturbing the peace. The applicant had had to be taken to the gendarmerie station as she had failed to stop making a commotion. At the station, she had been orally warned not to disturb her neighbours and then released, since Mr M.A.G. did not wish to lodge an official complaint. In the same report it is stated that the gendarmerie station is situated 150-200 metres from the scene o	[1]	2	2	0

On 8 May 2002 the Novogrodivka Town Court ordered the Novogrodivka Mining Company No. 1/3 – a State-owned enterprise – to pay the applicant arrears of compensation for loss of breadwinner, i.e. her husband, in the amount of 1,285.58[1] Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH). This judgment became final and on 6 August 2002 the Novogrodivka Town Bailiffs’ Service initiated the enforcement proceedings. In April 2004 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Novogrodivka Town Court against the Novogrodivka Town Bailiffs’ Service claiming compensation for the lengthy non-enforcement of the judgment in her favour. On 12 August 2004 the court found against the applicant. On 14 October 2004 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld this judgment. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court of Ukraine. According to her, in April 2005 the proceedings were still pending. The a	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1882	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Porvoo. In 1986 the applicant became allergic to ink used in her work as a window-dresser and decorator and was diagnosed as asthmatic. She was granted a rehabilitation allowance in order to be able to change career and to qualify for a new profession. From 1989 onwards she worked as an accountant. In 1997 her asthma became worse. The insurance company granted her a temporary accident pension in 1998 based on her annual income in 1986 when the asthma first started. The applicant appealed to the Accident Board (tapaturmalautakunta, olycksfallsnämnden), demanding that the accident pension be calculated on the basis of her income as an accountant instead of her income in 1986 since she was no longer employed in the same work as when the occupational disease was diagnosed. Moreover, she stated in her appeal that she was undergoing further tests for asthma in order to find out if she was suffering from a new occupati	[3]	2	2	1
1883	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Warsaw. The applicant was the director of a local branch in Warsaw of the bank PKO BP. On 26 January 2001 the applicant was arrested by officers of the Central Investigation Bureau (Centralne Biuro Śledcze, CBŚ) on suspicion of fraud and forgery of documents. On 27 January 2001 the Pruszków District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) dismissed the prosecutor’s request to impose on the applicant pre-trial detention finding that the suspicion against her had not been sufficiently justified. The decision was upheld on appeal by the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) on 20 March 2001. It appears that the Pruszków District Prosecutor continued the investigation against the applicant. On 9 June 2003 the applicant was again arrested by the CBŚ. She was charged with fraud, in that with the aim of financial gain she had caused substantial financial damage to the bank in granting suspect loans to clients of the bank. Moreove	[2]	2	2	0
1884	 The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Montreal. On 27 August 1993 the applicant’s mother lodged a civil action against her niece, A.M., to have set aside a sale contract concerning a flat entered into on 3 April 1986 between the applicant’s parents and A.M. On 9 September 1993 the applicant’s mother died and the applicant pursued the application. On 14 September 1993 the bailiff certified the existence of an action regarding the flat, and on 13 October 1993 the applicant notified A.M. not to enter into the flat, as it contained the goods inherited from her parents. In 1994, on an unknown date, she also filed a criminal complaint against A.M. According to the applicant, she had not received any answer to her letters from the prosecuting authorities. On 9 November 1994 the applicant supplemented the civil action, seeking to have the sale contract set aside for vitiated consent. She alleged that A.M. had deluded her parents into thinking that 	[3]	3	2	0
1885	 The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Oreovica (Serbia). On 10 July 1995 the applicant was injured in a car accident caused by M.I. She claimed damages in criminal proceedings that were instituted against M.I. In a final decision of 19 November 1998, the Piteşti Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) made awards in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage to both the applicant and her husband. It also ordered M.I. to pay a monthly amount to the applicant until her state of dependency ceased. On 7 July and 15 December 2000 the quantum of damages and the level of the monthly instalments to the applicant were brought up to date. On 15 November 2002 an application by the Prosecutor General at the Supreme Court of Justice to have the judgments in the criminal proceedings quashed (recurs în anulare) was granted by the Supreme Court of Justice, which therefore set aside the award for damage in respect of the applicant’s husband.

1886	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Cologne, Germany. On 27 October 1998 at 1 p.m. a group of 43 women belonging to “Mothers for Peace”, including the applicant, arrived at the provincial branch of the Motherland Party (Anavatan Partisi (ANAP)) in Istanbul in order to meet that party’s provincial leaders. Two women who received them at the entrance of the building stated that there was a press conference in progress, asked them to wait in the waiting room, which was on the third floor of the building, and left. Five to ten minutes later, police officers arrived in the waiting room, threw a smoke bomb inside and entered. A police officer hit the applicant on the back of her head with a truncheon, grabbed her hair and dragged her down the stairs. She was then put in a police vehicle and taken to the Beyoğlu police headquarters. On the same day at 3.50 p.m. the applicant, along with the other 42 women, was examined by a doctor at the Beyoğlu branch o	[1]	1	2	0
1887	 The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Novovoronezh, a town in the Voronezh Region. As a victim of Chernobyl, the applicant is entitled to benefits. Considering herself underpaid, she brought six sets of proceedings against the local welfare authority. On 18 October 2000 the Novovoronezh Town Court awarded the applicant arrears and legal costs in the amount of 3,014.09 Russian roubles (RUB). This judgment became binding on 28 October 2000 and was partly enforced on 24 September 2003. On 16 June 2003 the Town Court awarded the applicant more arrears in the amount of RUB 19,315.50. This judgment became binding on 19 August 2003 and was enforced on 17 December 2004. On 16 February 2004 the Town Court awarded the applicant arrears in the amount of RUB 16,765.50, and on 1 April 2004 the appeal court in addition fixed a new amount of periodic payments. This judgment became binding on 1 April 2004 and was enforced on 3 August 2005. On 15 M	[3, 9]	3	2	0
1888	 The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Petropavlosvk-Kamchatskiy, a town in the Kamchatka Region. The applicant lives in a municipally maintained flat. She sued the local council’s planning department and a municipal maintenance company for overdue repairs. On 29 April 2002 the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy Town Court awarded the applicant 60,729 Russian roubles (RUB) by way of damages and costs, and in addition ordered the defendants to “eliminate the cause of the leak in [the applicant’s flat] in the third quarter of 2002 by way of reconstructive repairs of the end wall and roof according to the estimate for selective repairs of the house.” This judgment became binding on 6 June 2002, but was not enforced immediately. On 19 August 2002 bailiffs closed enforcement proceedings against the planning department, because in the meantime it had been disbanded. On 19 February 2003 the bailiffs closed enforcement proceedings against the maintenance company because of it	[3, 9]	3	2	0
1889	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Istanbul. On 24 September 1998 the applicant, a student in the Faculty of Theology of İnönü University in Malatya, sought to enrol in the Faculty of Theology of Marmara University. For that purpose she provided, among other materials, an identity photograph which showed her wearing a headscarf. On 1 October 1998 the Faculty of Theology of Marmara University replied to the applicant, informing her that the identity photograph she had supplied did not comply with the regulations in force and that where this was the case, the person concerned could not be enrolled. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an application for judicial review with the Istanbul Administrative Court. She requested, in particular, that the refusal of the administrative authorities be set aside as being in breach of her rights. In a judgment of 23 September 1999, the Administrative Court rejected the application, finding that 	[3]	1	2	0
1890	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Oradea. On 14 May 1999, the applicant lodged with the Oradea District Court an action for recovery of possession (acţiune în revendicare) of a plot of land that, although recorded in the land register (cartea funciară) as belonging to the Oradea Local Council, she claimed she had inherited it from E.S. who had received it from the State in exchange for another plot of land. The three courts that dealt with the case found in favour of the applicant. The District Court gave its decision on 4 July 2000. Upon appeals by the Local Council, the Bihor County Court upheld it on 16 February 2001 and the Oradea Court of Appeal on 21 May 2001, the latter by means of a final and irrevocable decision. Before all the courts that dealt with the case, the Local Council argued that certificate no. 10524 of 14 May 1955, used by the applicant in order to prove her ownership title, was false as it contained a series of irregularities.

1891	 The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Town of Gayvoron. She worked as a judge at the Gayvoron Town Court and retired in February 2007. On 20 August 2002 the Pecherskyy District Court of Kyiv ordered the State Treasury to pay the applicant UAH 4,766[1] in compensation for her uniform. On 30 October 2002 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal upheld the judgment. On 3 December 2002 the Bailiffs instituted the enforcement proceedings. On 22 December 2003 the enforcement proceedings were discontinued for the lack of budgetary funds. On 3 October 2005 the judgment in the applicant’s favour was enforced in full.	[3, 9]	3	2	0
1892	 The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Timisoara, Romania. On 24 February 2002 the applicant’s passport and luggage were stolen in Nice when she was on her way back to Romania from a journey in Spain. After the French police had provided her with a document certifying that she had declared the theft, she continued her trip via Italy and Austria. On 25 February 2002 the Hungarian border police refused the applicant leave to enter Hungary and sent her back to the Austrian border police; on the same day, the Neusiedl/See District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) ordered her detention with a view to her expulsion pursuant to section 61(1) of the Aliens Act 1997 (Fremdengesetz 1997). The reasoning read as follows: “You entered Austrian territory, coming from Italy, at 10.30 a.m. on 25 February 2002 at 2425 Nickelsdorf (marker stone A29-30), circumventing border controls and without being in possession of a valid travel document and stamp.

1893	 The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Zakroczym. On 4 March 1986 the applicant’s mother lodged with the Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a motion for the dissolution of a co-ownership and division of an inheritance. The estate comprised, inter alia, a farm and plots of land located in Zakroczym. The applicant and her brother were also involved in the proceedings as parties. Between 4 March 1986 and 3 April 1992 the court scheduled fifteen hearings and appointed three experts. In the meantime, the applicant lodged several complaints about the unreasonable length of the proceedings, to no avail. On 3 April 1992 the court stayed the proceedings. They were resumed on 24 July 1995. Between 16 August 1995 and 14 May 2002 the court scheduled twenty-three hearings, thirteen of which were adjourned for various reasons, for instance the need to obtain additional evidence, in particular several experts’ reports. Three hearings were a	[3]	2	2	0
1894	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Budaörs. On 8 May 1998 the applicants’ neighbours brought an action against her and other respondents, claiming adverse possession of a right of way on their land. Between 1 May 1999 and 5 February 2001 the proceedings were interrupted because of the death of a plaintiff. Between 18 May 2001 and 16 March 2005 the Budaörs District Court held several hearings and obtained the opinion of an expert. Since 21 April 2005 the proceedings have been interrupted because one of the respondents died, his successor did not join the proceedings voluntarily and the plaintiffs failed to apply for the successor to be made a party to the proceedings. According to the information in the case file, the case is still pending before the first-instance court.	[3]	2	2	0
1895	 The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Hatay. On 15 September 1993 the applicant bought a plot of land (plot no. 1241), near the coast in Hatay. The land was registered in the applicant’s name in the Land Registry. She built a house there. On 4 July 1995 the Treasury brought an action before the Samandağ Court of First Instance, requesting the annulment of the applicant’s title deed to the land on the ground that it was located within the coastal area. On 16 December 1999 the Samandağ Court of First Instance upheld the Treasury’s request and decided to annul the title deed of the applicant to the plot of land. In its decision, the court held that, pursuant to domestic law, coastal areas could not be subject to private ownership and that, therefore, the applicant could not rely on the argument that she had acted bona fides. On 16 May 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. On 14 January 2002 a request by t	[9]	3	2	0
1896	 The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Timişoara. In 1950, a building situated in Timişoara, Spl. N. Titulescu no. 7, which was the property of the applicant’s husband and mother-in-law, was seized by the State under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation. On 26 May 1999 by a final decision the Timişoara Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) allowed an action by the applicant for rectification in the Land Register, acknowledged that the nationalisation of the building had been unlawful and ordered restitutio in integrum through the registration of the applicant’s right of property. It considered that the fact that some apartments in the building had been bought by the tenants had no influence on the solution, as the object of the proceedings was the validity of the State’s title and the titles of the buyers were therefore to be evaluated in another set of proceedings. On 30 September and 30 November 1999 the Timişoara Town Council certified in an of	[9]	3	2	0
1897	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Hajdúsámson. On 2 May 1989 the applicant filed for divorce. She also requested the division of the matrimonial property. After having pronounced the parties’ divorce in a partial decision, having held several hearings and obtained the opinions of experts, on 9 November 1994 the Debrecen District Court adopted a decision on the property. This was reversed by the Hajdú-Bihar County Regional Court on 20 June 1996. On 24 June 1997 the Supreme Court’s review bench quashed this decision and remitted the case to the second-instance court. In the resumed second-instance proceedings, the Regional Court held a hearing and quashed the District Court’s decision on 27 October 2000. In the resumed first-instance proceedings, on 5 June 2001 the District Court adopted a new decision concerning the property. This was reversed by the Regional Court on 23 November 2001.

1898	 The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in St Petersburg. In February 1998 she lodged a court action against her brother and the St Petersburg Committee on Land Management with the Vyborgskiy District Court of St Petersburg (“the District Court”). She claimed that her brother had unlawfully acquired the title deeds to a plot of land adjacent to her house and had destroyed her garden. In the course of the proceedings the applicant amended her claim several times. On 20 July 1998 Judge A. accepted the case for examination. Several hearings were scheduled in 1998 and in the first half of 1999. They were adjourned either because the parties failed to appear or because the judge was on sick leave. On 8 June 1999 the District Court refused to examine the case on the grounds that the applicant had failed to appear at two court hearings. The applicant requested the District Court to reinstate the proceedings as she had not been duly notified of the hearings. On 	[3]	3	2	0
1899	 The applicant is a German national and lives in Buchholz. On 21 September 1995 the applicant was granted divorce and concluded an interim settlement (Zwischenvergleich) with her former husband regarding her maintenance claims in the amount of 1.600 German marks (approximately 818 Euros (EUR)) subject to future variations from the date of the divorce. On 10 August 2001 the applicant instituted claims in sequence before the Hamburg-Wandsbek District Court in order to first obtain information on her former husband’s income and assets, and subsequently request the variation of her maintenance claims in accordance with the provided information. The claim was received by the court on 21 August 2001 and registered under file number “732 F 8/01”. The scheduled hearings of 11 and 18 December 2001 were postponed at the request of the applicant’s former husband (the defendant). On 5 February 2002 an oral hearing was set for 27 March 2002. At the hearing the	[3]	0	2	1
1900	 The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Moscow. The applicant’s father owned a flat in Moscow. In June 1993, a certain K., acting on behalf of the applicant’s father, sold the flat to L. In October 1993 the applicant’s father died. Later, L. made a gift of that flat to her son. In February 1995 the applicant lodged a court action with the Butyrskiy District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”) against K. and L. and L.’s son, seeking annulment of the contract of sale of his father’s flat. The Moscow department of housing policy, the registration service and the notary who had certified the power of authority delivered by the applicant’s father were invited as third parties to the proceedings. Between 1995 and 1997 several hearings were listed, but they were adjourned for various reasons. In 1998 the examination of the case was postponed several times because the third parties or the defendants failed to appear. According to the Government, the hearin	[3]	1	2	0
1901	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Budapest. On 26 July 1991 the applicant brought an action against an insurance company seeking compensation for injuries she had suffered in a road traffic accident. The dispute essentially concerned the amount of compensation payable. After having obtained two expert opinions and held numerous hearings, on 5 November 1997 the Budapest Regional Court gave judgment. On 9 March 2000 the Supreme Court quashed this decision. In the resumed proceedings, on 5 February 2002 the Budapest Regional Court awarded the applicant 8.2 million Hungarian forints (HUF) in compensation in addition to a monthly allowance. On 28 April 2004 the Supreme Court’s appellate bench amended this decision, reducing the award. This judgment was final and served on 28 June 2004. On 14 September 2004 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s request for rectification of the judgment holding that her allegations related to the	[3]	2	2	0
1902	 On 19 April 1995 the applicant, who was born in 1939 and lives in Ventspils, was arrested by the Jelgava police and remanded in custody until 13 June 1995. During this period of time some of the applicant’s property stored in her house in Jelgava, where a café belonging to her was also located, and in her second house in Dobele, was stolen. Criminal proceedings were initiated in this connection. On 23 May 1995 criminal proceedings in case no. 22546495 were initiated regarding the burglary in Jelgava. On 25 May 1995 the Jelgava police decided to acknowledge the applicant as a civil claimant in criminal case no. 22546495, with a claim for 763 Latvian lati (LVL) (approximately EUR 1,090). On 11 July 1995 another set of criminal proceedings, allocated case number no. 22564195, was initiated regarding the burglary in Jelgava. On the same date the Jelgava police decided to acknowledge the applicant as a civil claimant in criminal case no. 22564195, with a claim	[3]	3	2	0
1903	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Budapest. In April 1997 the applicant bought a flat from a private individual, S.M. The seller stipulated that she had the right to buy back the property until 30 July 1997. However, she was not able to exercise this right because of the lack of sufficient means. In September 1997 the Land Registry registered the applicant’s property rights on the flat. Subsequently, the applicant requested S.M. to let him have possession. Since S.M. was reluctant to leave the flat, the applicant requested the Gödöllő District Court to order the execution of the purchase contract – which had been concluded by a notary public (közjegyzői okirat) and, therefore, was executable as a final court judgment. The District Court issued the order on 10 November 1997. Subsequently, S.M. brought an action against the applicant before the Gödöllő District Court, requesting the court to establish the invalidity of the purchase contract and to	[3]	2	2	0
1904	 The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Libertów. On 18 November 1993 the applicant divorced. On 17 June 1994 she lodged with the Kraków District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a claim for division of matrimonial property consisting of a family house in Jankówka and a right to a flat in a housing-co-operative in Kraków. Between 8 November 1994 and 2 August 2000, the Kraków District Court scheduled forty-five hearings, nine of which were adjourned and one expert report was obtained. On 13 December 2000 the court issued an interim order (zarządzenie tymczasowe) securing the applicant’s claim. On 19 December 2000 the defendant appealed against the making of the order. On 19 July 2001 the court amended its order. At a hearing held on 16 November 2001 the Kraków District Court gave a preliminary decision (postanowienie wstępne) on the parties’ respective shares in the matrimonial property. The applicant and the defendant appealed on 4 Feb	[3]	2	2	0
1905	 The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Głogów. On 12 June 2000 Ms M.Ł. informed the police that her 17 year-old granddaughter (M.H.) had been raped by the applicant and J.K. Subsequently, the police opened an investigation into the allegations. M.H. was questioned by the police on 12 June and by a prosecutor on 5 July 2000. The police were unsuccessful in their attempts to arrest the applicant as he had gone into hiding. On 6 July 2000 M.H. was heard by the Jelenia Góra District Court, at the request of the prosecutor, pursuant to Article 316 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Apparently, the prosecutor had attempted to notify the applicant of the hearing, but he had been absent from his place of residence. On 17 August 2000 the Jelenia Góra District Court ordered that the applicant be detained on remand for a period of seven days from the day of his arrest. On 6 September 2000 the prosecutor issued a warrant for his arrest. </	[3]	2	2	0
1906	 The applicant was born in 1908 and lived in Sebeş. In 1950, a house and 1,460 sq. m of appurtenant land situated in Cluj-Napoca, Calea Turzii no. 26, the property of the applicant’s parents, were seized by the State under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation. On 24 July 1996 the applicant claimed compensation for the property under Law no. 112/1995. She states that she has not received any compensation. On an unknown date the property was divided into several parts. It appears from the documents in the file that the property, made up of two constructions and appurtenant land, was divided into five apartments and two plots of appurtenant land of 1,058 sq. m and 116 sq. m respectively. On 31 October, 15 November and 10 December 1996, and 3 February and 27 March 1997 the State sold the five apartments to the then tenants. It appears from the file that the two plots of appurtenant land were not made the object of a sale. On 3 March 2000 the	[9]	3	2	0
1907	 The applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Poznań. The applicant owns a house. In 1980 her neighbours constructed their house as the other part of the semi-detached house. It appears that their plumbing system was placed in a wall separating the two houses without necessary acoustic insulation. The applicant repeatedly complained about the noise caused by the neighbours’ plumbing system. On 6 May 1993 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Poznań Regional Prosecutor, alleging inactivity on the part of the administrative authorities in dealing with her grievances. On 9 July 1993 the Regional Prosecutor applied to the Poznań District Office to institute proceedings with a view to determining whether the plumbing system complied with the applicable legal regulations. On 31 January 1994 the Mayor of Poznań, who had assumed the competences of the District Office, refused to institute proceedings. On 29 March 1994 the Poznań Governor quashed that decision.

The applicant is the founder and owner of a publishing company “Metskaitliai”. Since 1995 the company has published “Lithuanian calendar” (Lietuvio kalendorius), a yearly calendar with notes by the applicant and other contributors describing various historic dates from the perspective of its authors. The calendar could be purchased in bookstores. It was distributed in Lithuania and among Lithuanian immigrants living abroad. On 4 January 2000 a Member of the Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas) distributed a public announcement, stating that the texts published in “Lithuanian calendar 2000” insulted persons of Polish, Russian and Jewish origin. The relevant parts of “Lithuanian calendar” read as follows: [First page of the calendar]: “Lietuva – the land of the Lithuanians, as each footprint here bears traces of our Nation's blood” 15 February: 	[3]	2	2	0
1909	 The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Ankara. On 1 November 1990 the applicant had an accident while entering a lift in the Balıkçıoğlu Business Centre in Ankara. The applicant subsequently learned that the lift had been under repair at the material time, despite the lack of any warning signs to this effect in the building, and that the accident had been caused by her attempt to operate the lift under those circumstances. Following the accident the applicant was taken to the Ankara Numune Hospital where she received medical treatment. According to the report drawn up by an orthopaedist in that hospital on 20 August 1991, the applicant suffered a thoracic vertebral fracture as a result of the accident, was unfit for work for 45 days and was required to undergo 180 days of treatment. Criminal proceedings were subsequently brought against the two workers who had been repairing the lift at the time (case no. 1990/986), on charges of causing injury thro	[3]	2	2	0
1910	The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Štip. The applicant worked in Stopanska Banka A.D. Skopje (“the Bank”). On 10 March 1997 she was dismissed under, inter alia, section 19-a of the Restructuring Act of some of the banks in the Republic of Macedonia (“the Restructuring Act”). A redundancy allowance (испратнина) was paid to her. On 22 April 1997 the applicant challenged her dismissal before the Štip Court of First Instance (“the first-instance court”) alleging non-compliance with the procedural requirements of the Labour Act (“Act”) (Закон за работните односи). She further claimed that section 19-a of the Restructuring Act had been discriminatory and accordingly, unconstitutional. None of the five hearings listed before the first-instance court was adjourned at the applicant’s request. During the proceedings, the applicant specified her claim on three occasions. On 27 March 1998 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant’s claim, finding that the	[3]	2	2	0

On 7 August 1998, the Berdyansk Court convicted Ms K. and Ms L. of fraud and awarded the applicant 19,357 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH)[1] in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused to the applicant by these persons. As the judgment of 7 August 1998 had not been enforced by the Berdyansk Bailiffs’ Service (Відділ державної виконавчої служби Бердянського міського управління юстиції Запорізької області), the applicant instituted proceedings against the latter in the Berdyansk Court. The applicant claimed compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused to her by the lengthy non-enforcement of the judgment. On 19 December 2002 the court found in part for the applicant.

On 31 December 2003 she brought proceedings against the Social Security Office of Belogorsk on account of a refusal by the latter to increase her child benefit payments according to a certain method of calculation and seeking compensation in respect of pecuniary damage. She also alleged that the Office had not given her access to a number of documents concerning those payments. By a judgment of 30 November 2004 the Belogorsk Town Court dismissed her claims as unfounded. The applicant’s representative lodged an appeal against the judgment on 12 December 2004. The Amur Regional Court scheduled a hearing for 25 February 2005. According to the Government, on 17 February 2005 the Town Court dispatched summonses to the parties.

On 13 July 2004 the Municipal Court again granted the interim custody sought and, in	[]	2	2	0
1914	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Moscow. The applicant worked as chief physician in a hospital managed by the Moscow patriarchate. On 29 November 2000 the applicant on her own initiative left her place of work in order to participate in a conference dedicated to the fight against drug addiction in Russia, organised by the Russian Orthodox Church. On 18 December 2000 the applicant was dismissed for unjustified absence from work on 29 November 2000. She believed that the dismissal was unlawful and brought civil proceedings for reinstatement and for compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. On 28 March 2001 the Simonovskiy District Court of Moscow partly allowed the claims, ordered her reinstatement and awarded her 19,401.03 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of pecuniary damage. The applicant’s claims for non-pecuniary damage were dismissed. On 14 May 2001 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment on appeal. On 16 May 2001 the M	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1915	 The applicant’s family lived in the village of Ąžuolpamušio, Pasvalys district. Her husband died on 15 April 2002.

1918	 The applicant was born in 1931 and lives in Andrushivka, Zhytomyr region, Ukraine. By its judgment of 8 December 2000, the Andrushivka District Court awarded the applicant 700 Ukrainian hryvnyas (UAH) in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused to her by Mr Y. It appears that this judgment became final and the enforcement proceedings were initiated. No further information about enforcement of this judgment is available. In February 2002 the applicant lodged a claim with the Bogunsky District Court of Zhytomyr against the Bogunsky District Bailiffs’ Service of Zhytomyr (відділ державної виконавчої служби Богунського районного управління юстиції м.

1919	 The applicant was born in 1929 and lives in Ylöjärvi. On 20 July 2000 she took her daughter's son to a doctor. The boy was three years old at the time. According to the doctor's report, the applicant said that she had noticed a bruise on the boy's back which might have been caused by a blow, and that his behaviour had been abnormal since he had visited his father, T. The applicant had strong suspicions that the injuries were consistent with physical violence. Furthermore, it was written in the report that the applicant had informed the doctor that the boy had said that the bruise had been caused by a punch. The applicant further stated that in January 2000 she had noticed signs of violence for the first time, but that T. had explained that the boy had fallen down the stairs. The doctor wrote in his report that the bruise noted on the boy's back was consistent with a punch, thereby supporting the boy's account, given also to the doctor, that he had been hit by his 	[6]	3	2	1
1920	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Donetsk of the Rostov Region. The applicant sued the Donetsk Social Welfare Office («Управление социальной защиты населения г. Донецка») for arrears in child benefits and for compensation of non-pecuniary damage. On 27 December 2000 the Donetsk Town Court of the Rostov Region, composed of a professional judge Mr P. and two lay judges, partly allowed her claims. The judgment became enforceable on 7 January 2001. On 25 July 2002 the Presidium of the Rostov Regional Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case. On 2 October 2002 the Donetsk Town Court, composed of the judge Mr P. and two lay judges, ordered that the Donetsk Social Welfare Office pay the applicant 1,506.27 Russian roubles (RUB, approximately EUR 49) in respect of child benefits adjusted for inflation and legal costs and expenses.

1921	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Volgodonsk, a town in the Rostov Region. In 1999 she lost her home in a terrorist bomb attack. On 1 November 2002 the Leninskiy District Court of Krasnodar ordered a local authority to provide the applicant with a flat within three months of the judgment’s entry into force. This judgment entered into force on 19 December 2002. On 19 February 2003 the District Court clarified the judgment and indicated that the flat had to measure at least 72 m². In 2002–04 the local authority several times applied for a supervisory review of the judgment, and pending this procedure the enforcement was stayed. On 12 March 2004 the local authority offered the applicant a flat, but she refused it. On 9 August 2004 the local authority offered another flat (measuring 76.78 m²) and the applicant accepted it. On 28 September 2004 the applicant’s ownership was formalised.	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1922	 The applicant was born in 1987 and lives in Flers. The applicant, a Muslim aged eleven at the material time, was enrolled in the first year of a state secondary school in Flers for the academic year 1998-1999. From January 1999 onwards she wore a headscarf to school. On seven occasions in January 1999 the applicant went to physical education and sports classes wearing her headscarf and refused to take it off despite repeated requests to do so by her teacher, who explained that wearing a headscarf was incompatible with physical education classes. The teacher sent two reports to the headmaster dated 22 January and 8 February 1999. At a meeting on 11 February 1999 the school's pupil discipline committee decided to expel the applicant from the school for breaching the duty of assiduity by failing to participate actively in physical education and sports classes. The applicant's parents appealed against that decision to the appeal panel. In a	[]	1	2	1
1923	 The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in the village of Serzhen-Yurt, the Chechen Republic. The applicant lived with her husband, Mr Sharani Askharov (born in 1956), at 106 Sheripova Street in the village of Serzhen-Yurt. The applicant is a housewife, and her husband was a lorry driver. Together they had two daughters, one of whom is away from home for long periods of time for medical reasons. In the same courtyard there are five houses; the four others are owned by the applicant’s husband’s brothers and their families. According to the applicant, early in the morning of 18 May 2001 a “sweeping operation” (зачистка) took place in Serzhen-Yurt. At about 5 a.m. a group of armed men wearing masks and dressed in camouflage broke into the applicant’s home and entered the room where the applicant, her husband and their 12-year-old daughter were sleeping. The applicant was forced by a man armed with a sub-machine gun to stand against the wall in the hall, while other 	[0, 1, 2]	2	2	0
1924	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Grozny, Chechnya. The applicant has a daughter and three grandsons. Her family lived at 9 Kiyevskiy Lane in the Staropromyslovskiy district of Grozny. Prior to the resumption of hostilities in Chechnya in 1999 the applicant was a lecturer in the Chechen and Russian languages and in teaching methods at the Chechen branch of the Business and Administration University of Ingushetia. In October 1999 hostilities resumed between Russian forces and Chechen armed groups. Grozny came under heavy aerial and artillery bombardment.

1925	 The applicant was born in 1919 and lives in Voronezh of the Voronezh Region. On 4 November 2000 the Talovskiy District Court of the Voronezh Region granted the applicant’s civil action against the Social Welfare Department of the Talovskiy District and awarded her 756.52 Russian roubles (RUB) in pension arrears. The judgment was not appealed against and became enforceable on 15 November 2000. At some point the domestic court issued the applicant with the writ of execution in respect of the judgment. At the end of November 2000 the bailiffs received the writ. At some point in 2001 the bailiffs’ service returned the writ to the applicant without execution, since the respondent authority did not have funds available for enforcement of the applicant’s claim. It appears that on 9 February 2006 the applicant resubmitted the writ of execution to the respondent authority. On 1 March 2007 the award was paid to the applicant in full.	[3, 9]	3	2	0
1926	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Urus-Martan, the Chechen Republic. At the material time the applicant worked in the administration of the Urus-Martan District (администрация Урус-Мартановского района, “the Urus-Martan administration”) and lived in an apartment in a block of flats in Urus-Martan. She had a son, Mr Artur Bersunkayev, born in 1979, who lived at the time with the applicant’s brother-in-law, Mr Ayndi Bersunkayev, and the latter’s family, in a privately owned house at 51 Partizanskaya Street, Urus-Martan. The applicant did not witness the apprehension of her son and her account was based on statements by her brother-in-law and his wife, Mrs Layla Tsugayeva. On 13 June 2001, at around 4 a.m., a group of men arrived at 51 Partizanskaya Street and attempted to break down the door of the house.

1927	 The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in the town of Solnechnogorsk in the Moscow Region. On 8 March 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed franchise fraud, that is, having organised a financial pyramid scheme in which more than one hundred persons had been enrolled and which had caused fraudulent losses of over 23,000,000 Russian roubles. Three days later a prosecutor authorised the applicant’s placement in custody on the ground that she was charged with a serious criminal offence and was liable to abscond and pervert the course of justice. On 6 May and 2 July 1999 the Omsk Regional Prosecutor extended the applicant’s detention until 8 July and 8 September 1999 respectively, having regard to the gravity of the charges. On 3 September and 29 November 1999 a deputy Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, invoking the same grounds as in the previous detention orders, authorised the extension of the applicant’s detention un	[1, 2]	2	2	0
1928	 The applicant was born in 1935 and lives in Grigoreşti. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1996 the applicant received from the local authority in the village of Alexandreni a plot of land which she still uses. She was not, however, given title to the land, so in December 2003 she requested the local authority to transfer title to her. On 20 February 2004 her request was turned down. She then brought court proceedings for the annulment of that decision and an order requiring the local authority to grant her title to the land. She explained that she continued to use it but needed a document proving her ownership. On 9 June 2004 the Sîngerei District Court granted her request and ordered the local authority to transfer title to her. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final and enforceable 15 days later. The applicant obtained a warrant of execution which she lodged with the Decis	[3]	3	2	0
1929	 The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Masku. On 16 February 1980 the applicant was injured in a car accident. On 15 October 1980 the Turku City Court (raastuvanoikeus, rådstuvurätten) rejected her request to increase the amount of compensation she had already received from an insurance company. She unsuccessfully appealed against the decision to the Turku Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten) and subsequently the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen), which gave their decisions on 13 May and 5 October 1981 respectively. Subsequently, another insurance company, as well as the Social Insurance Institution (kansaneläkelaitos, folkpensionsanstalten) granted the applicant a pension on grounds of her disability. On 14 September 1993 the Supreme Court partly annulled the above court decisions in the light of new medical evidence presented by the applicant. On 1 December 1993 she filed a new claim for compensation alleging that she had become p	[3]	3	2	1

1931	 The applicant was born in 1918 and lives in the town of Vyshgorod, Kyiv Region, Ukraine. In 1994 the applicant, resident of Donetsk at that time, moved to Kyiv. She issued a letter of authority to Mr R. who promised to help the applicant to exchange her apartment in Donetsk for one in Kyiv. Mr R. sold her apartment to Mrs P. and the latter had subsequently sold it to Mrs L. The applicant allegedly received no money for it. In February 1995 Mrs L. instituted proceedings in the Voroshylovskyy District Court of Donetsk (the “Voroshylovskyy Court”), claiming that the applicant had lost her right to reside in the apartment. On 22 February 1995 the Voroshylovskyy Court found for Mrs L.

At the beginning of February 1999 the applicant complained to her doctor Ms K. about the neighbours, who had allegedly subjected her to electromagnetic emissions, attempted to contaminate her with HIV, created noises and draughts and tortured her in a multitude of other ways. She threatened to pour acid on them. On 10 February 1999 the applicant was examined by a medical panel comprising two psychiatrists and three general practitioners affiliated with the Baltiysk Town Medical Association. The panel concluded that the applicant suffered from a paranoid personality disorder and was hallucinatory and aggressive. She was therefore dangerous to the public and to herself. The doctors also found that the applicant suffered from hypertension. On the same day she was taken to the Kaliningrad Regional psychiatric hospital No. 1 (hereinafter “the hospital”).

1935	 The applicant was born in 1909 and lives in Volodymyr-Volynsky, in the Volyn Region, Ukraine. In 1971 the Volodymyr-Volynsky Town Council granted the applicant a protected tenancy of a plot of land for permanent use (безстрокове користування земельною ділянкою); subsequently the applicant gained property rights over the plot. According to the applicant, in 1984 her neighbour, C., built a garage occupying part of her land. In May 1994 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Volodymyr-Volynsky Town Court (“the Town Court”) against C., seeking to remove the impediments to her possession of the plot of land at issue. She also sought compensation. On 10 August 1995, in the context of conciliatory proceedings, a municipal land commission defined the boundary between the plots and placed a set of land markers to make it visible.

1939	 The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Arkhangelsk. In 1994 the applicant paid 10,000,000 Russian roubles (RUB) to a cooperative society whose main activity was the construction of garages (гаражно-строительный кооператив) in order to be provided with a garage as one of its members. Since she was not provided with one, on 30 January 1995 the applicant sued the society by lodging a claim with the Lomonosovskiy District Court of Arkhangelsk. The applicant sought to be reinstated as a member of the society and to have her property rights in respect of the garage recognised. The hearing was adjourned on six occasions: twice due to the need to collect evidence; twice due to the respondent’s failure to appear, once due to the necessity to summon witnesses and once without any specified reason. On 28 March 1996 the Lomonosovskiy District Court of Arkhangelsk dismissed the applicant’s claim. The court found that she had never been accepted as a member of the	[9]	2	2	0
1940	 The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Snina. In the 1950s State authorities took land and other agricultural property from the applicant’s father. The property was put at the disposal of a cooperative. Following the fall of the communist regime the applicant and the other members of the family sought restitution of the property. They relied mainly on the Land Ownership Act 1991. The following relevant events occurred and decisions were taken in that context. In August 1991 and on 20 November 1992 the applicant, together with other members of her family, claimed restitution of three plots of land which were used by a cooperative. On 2 December 1992 the Land Office in Michalovce found that the claimants were entitled to have the land restored to them. It further decided that the claimants were co-owners of the land at issue. On 29 December 1992 the cooperative challenged that decision before the Košice Regional Court. On 23 March 199	[3]	3	2	0

1948	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Norilsk in the Krasnoyarsk Region of the Russian Federation. In August 1998 the applicant, formerly an engineer in a public company, was made redundant. On 3 September 1998 she was registered in the Norilsk Employment Centre. As the unemployment allowances were paid to the applicant after a substantial delay and, as she believed, their calculation was not correct, in March 2000 she sued the Norilsk Employment Centre for the allowance arrears, adjusted for inflation, and interest thereon. On 25 September 2000 the Norilsk Town Court of the Krasnoyarsk Region allowed the applicant's claims in part. It awarded her 677.35 Russian roubles (RUR) for arrears and RUR 4,568.53 for the indexation of the arrears to take account of inflation.

The supervising court, the Appeal Court (hovioikeus, hovrätten), questioned on several occasions her ability to continue to work. In 1991 and 1994 the Appeal Court concluded, however, that the applicant’s condition was not serious enough to justify her dismissal. In 2000 the issue was again brought up. On 6 June the senior judge of the District Court informed the Appeal Court about the applicant’s situation. On 19 June the Appeal Court requested the applicant to submit a medical certificate. On 8 September 2000 the applicant submitted a certificate which showed that she was capable of performing her judicial functions.

1960	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Tbilisi. In a judgment of 29 November 1999, the Didube-Chughureti District Court in Tbilisi recognised the applicant’s mother as the owner of part of her family house. Under a gift contract of 26 January 2000, the applicant’s mother had donated her estate to her three children, including the applicant. The contract was certified by a notary and recorded in the Public Registry. According to the applicant, her part of the house was occupied by Mr E. – a descendant of the family who had been leasing the premises since 1923. The legal relations between her ancestors and those of Mr E. had allegedly represented an informal tenancy whereby the tenants had held possession with the landlords’ consent but without any fixed terms.

On 26 September 2001, when the case was heard before the Athens Criminal Court, the applicant reiterated her civil-party application, claiming 1,000 drachmas (about 3 euros) and adduced her arguments. On the same day, the Athens Criminal Court acquitted S.M. of the charges against him, finding that the app	[3]	0	2	1
1975	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Poprad. On 14 April 1993 the District Court in Poprad restricted the applicant’s legal capacity in that she was not allowed to act on her own before public authorities. The court relied on the opinion of several experts concluding that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder as a result of paranoid development of her personality. The applicant suffered from the delusion that she was being persecuted and on that ground she had made a considerable number of complaints and other submissions. The applicant’s mother was appointed guardian for the purpose of the proceedings concerning the limitation of the applicant’s legal capacity. On 18 April 1994 the Regional Court in Košice upheld the first-instance judgment, which became final on 26 July 1994. On 1 August 1994 the District Court in Poprad brought proceedings on its own initiative with a view to appointing a guardian for the applicant, whose legal capacity 	[3, 4]	2	2	0
1976	 The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Armavir, a town in Armenia. A warrant officer of the Russian Border Guard Service (“Service”), she serves in a unit stationed in Armenia. In June 2000 the applicant requested an early discharge because of structural changes in her service. Under domestic law, long-serving personnel in need of better housing (the applicant met these conditions) could be discharged against their will only if the command provided them with such housing. When asking for discharge, the applicant specified that she wished to receive the housing. As no housing was provided, in November 2003 the applicant sued the Director of the Service for provision of housing and an early discharge. On behalf of the defendant the trial was attended by X, a major of military justice acting on the basis of a power of attorney. X accepted the applicant’s claim and on 15 March 2004 the Fifth Garrison Military Court ordered the Director to provide the app	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1977	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Olsztyn. On the evening of 27 December 1999 the applicant met with her friend. Subsequently the applicant took a taxi to go home and refused to pay the allegedly exorbitant fare without obtaining a proper bill. As a result, the driver did not let the applicant out of the taxi in front of her house but took her to a sobering‑up centre in Olsztyn. The applicant called the police from the taxi as she felt threatened by the driver’s behaviour. So did the driver as regards the applicant’s behaviour. Subsequently, the applicant was detained in the sobering‑up centre. She refused to undergo a breathalyser test. The applicant submitted that she had had two beers. The Government maintained that she had been in a state of “average intoxication”. The applicant submitted that the staff of the centre had insulted her and that she had been brutally manhandled and beaten. She had also been forcibly stripped naked by t	[1]	2	2	0
1978	 The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Istanbul. On 13 July 1992 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of the Revolutionary Left (the “DEV-SOL”), an illegal organisation. On 28 July 1992 she was brought before a single judge at the Istanbul State Security Court who ordered her detention on remand. On 18 September and 14 October 1992 and 26 May 1995, the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed three bills of indictment, charging the applicant with attempting to undermine the constitutional order, proscribed by Article 146 of the former Criminal Code. The case against the applicant was joined to another brought against five other persons. On 28 September 1992 the first hearing before the Istanbul State Security Court was taken up with procedural matters. By 24 December 2002 the applicant had made several requests for release pending trial to the Istanbul State Security Court. The c	[2, 3]	2	2	0
1979	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Urus-Martan. The applicant’s husband, Mr Magomed Uvaysovich Dzhabayev, was born in 1953. They resided together with their three children born in 1985, 1987 and 1994 at 50 Tobolskaya Street in Grozny (Грозный, ул. Тобольская, д. 50). However, on an unspecified date in 1999 the applicant with her three children temporarily moved to the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia where they stayed in the town of Karabulak in a camp for migrants from Chechnya. In her application form the applicant submitted that on 10 March 2000 Mr Dzhabayev had been apprehended by officers of the Oktyabrskiy Temporary Office of the Interior (VOVD) in the yard of his house at 50 Tobolskaya Street in Grozny. Subsequently he had been taken to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, after which he was never seen again. At the same time the applicant enclosed a copy of her application to the Chairman of the National Public Commission for Investigation of Offence	[0, 1, 2]	2	2	0
1980	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Ryazan. She is a military servicewoman. From January 2000 to February 2001 she served in the Russian contingent of the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Upon her return, the applicant brought proceedings against the head of her military unit to secure payment of her daily allowance for her service abroad. On 25 July 2003 the Military Court of the Ryazan Garrison partly granted the applicant’s claim and ordered the military unit to pay the applicant 346,050.70 Russian roubles (RUB) in remuneration and RUB 1,000 in expenses for legal advice. The military unit did not lodge an ordinary appeal, and on 22 August 2003 the judgment became binding and enforceable. However, following the respondent’s request, on 19 November 2003 the Presidium of the Military Court of the Moscow Command quashed the judgment of 25 July 2003 by way of supervisory review and dismissed the applicant’s claims	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1981	 The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Łomża. On 7 March 1991 the applicant instituted administrative proceedings. She sought compensation for the expropriation of her real property which took place on 16 October 1957 by a decision of the Presidium of the Regional National Council (Prezydium Wojewódzkiej Rady Narodowej). On 11 June 1991 the Director of the Łomża District Office refused to grant the applicant compensation for the expropriated real estate. She appealed. On 25 September 1991 the Łomża Governor upheld the Council’s decision. On 23 January 1992 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s request for compensation. Following a judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court on 15 May 1994 the applicant requested that the property in question be returned to her. On 29 July 1994 the Director of the Łomża District Office refused to restore the property. It was found that the property had been used in accordance wi	[3]	3	2	0
1982	 The applicant was born in 1925 and lives in Košice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 17 May 1996 the applicant filed an action with the Košice – okolie District Court. She sought the dissolution of a joint ownership of real property. On 18 August 2004 the Constitutional Court found that the Košice – okolie District Court had violated the applicant’s right under Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution to a hearing without unjustified delay. The case was not complex. The applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings in that she had challenged judges and an expert. The District Court was responsible for delays totalling 53 months. The Constitutional Court awarded SKK 40,000 (the equivalent of approximately 1,000 euros at that time) to the applicant as just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage. It also ordered the District Court to avoid any further delay in the proceedings and to	[3]	3	2	0
1983	 The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Urus-Martan, Chechnya. She is the mother of Bekkhan Alaudinov, who was born in 1976. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In November 2001 the town of Urus-Martan, Chechnya, was under the full control of the Russian military forces. A curfew was imposed in the area. All roads to and from the town were blocked by Russian military checkpoints. On the night of 8 November 2001 the applicant and her sons Bekkhan and Aslanbek Alaudinov were in their house at 30 Proletarskaya Street, in Urus-Martan, Chechnya. At about 4.30 a.m. someone knocked at the door of the applicant’s house. When the applicant asked who was there, she was told that it was the police. After she opened the door, three armed men in camouflage uniform entered the house. Two of them were wearing masks; the third one did not have a mask and had a Slavic appearance. The men neither introduced themse	[0, 1, 2]	3	2	0
1984	 The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Szczecin. The applicant had been a judge for twenty‑seven years. By virtue of an amendment to the law on the System of Common Courts 1985, which came into effect on 17 October 1997, the status of a “retired judge” was created (see paragraph 24 below). On 4 December 1997 the applicant who had retired on 8 July 1997 on grounds of ill health acquired the status of a “retired judge”. Under the applicable provisions of domestic law retired judges were entitled, as from 1 January 1998, to a special retirement pension equivalent to seventy‑five per cent of their last full salary (sędziowski stan spoczynku) every month. On 3 August 1997 the Lustration Act entered into force. By a further amendment to the 1985 Law of 17 December 1997, which came into effect on 15 August 1998, retired judges who had acquired the right to a special retirement pension were required to submit a declaration under that Act. In September 1998 the applic	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1985	 The applicant was born in 1935 and lives in Mendeleyevo, a town in the Moscow Region. In 1995 the applicant brought a court action against a housing maintenance service. Throughout the proceedings she represented herself. She claimed compensation for damages sustained as a result of poor quality repairs carried out by the respondent in her flat and requested that the works be done again. She also claimed penalties for the delays in the reparation of her flat. In course of the proceedings the applicant amended her claims. On 27 November 1995 the Solnechnogorskiy Town Court of the Moscow Region (“the Town Court”) dismissed her claim. On 6 February 1996 the Moscow Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) upheld that judgment. On 28 May 1996 the Presidium of the Regional Court quashed the judgment of 27 November 1995 and remitted the case for a fresh examination to the first-instance court. In the meantime the administration of the Solnechnogorskiy Dist	[3]	3	2	0
1986	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Skopje. On 1 February 1993 Mr. F.D., the applicant’s former husband, bought a state-owned apartment and a garage (“the property”). By a deed of gift of 29 December 1994 (“the 1994 gift”), Mr F.D. transferred one notional half of the property into the applicant’s possession. The spouses divorced in 1996. By court decisions of 18 April and 5 September 2001 respectively, the 1994 gift was rescinded. The present case concerns two sets of proceedings concerning the property at issue. On 13 July 1995 Mr H.D. and Mrs V.D., Mr F.D.’s parents (“the plaintiffs”), brought a civil action against the applicant and Mr F.D. to establish their title to the property and to rescind the 1994 gift. The plaintiffs alleged that they had transferred to their son the right to buy the property and that they had paid the price. Of six hearings scheduled between 3 November 1995 and 19 May 1997, none was rescheduled on the applica	[3]	2	2	0
1987	 The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Astrakhan. On 5 September 2003 the applicant gave birth to a daughter out of wedlock. On 11 November 2003 she lodged a claim with the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan against Mr A., with whom she allegedly had been in a relationship since 2000, in order to establish paternity and obtain child maintenance. In the course of the proceedings the applicant was represented by a counsel. On 15 December 2003 the court ordered a DNA test to be carried out. The blood samples were collected in Astrakhan and sent to a specialised institute in Moscow for a forensic genetic examination. According to the expert conclusion submitted on 19 March 2004, the probability that Mr A. was the father of the applicant’s daughter was 99.99%. On 2 June 2004 the court heard the defendant’s representative, who contested the admissibility of the DNA test on account of procedural shortcomings, and the applicant, who insisted on i	[4]	1	2	0
1988	 The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Śrem. In 1995 the applicant’s husband died on a pedestrian crossing after being hit by a car. The car was being driven by a certain B.M. On 20 July 1998 the applicant filed a claim against B.M. and the “Warta” Insurance Company with the Poznań Regional Court, seeking compensation in the amount of 50,000 Polish zlotys (PLN). At the same time the applicant requested the court to give her a full exemption from the costs of the proceedings. She submitted that she received only a small pension and that her health had significantly deteriorated. On 21 June 1998 the Regional Court partly granted the applicant’s request. It exempted her from the court fee for processing her claim (wpis od pozwu). On 25 November 1999 the Śrem District Court in the course of criminal proceedings convicted B.M. of having caused a traffic accident which resulted in a fatality and sentenced him, inter alia, to a suspended prison term	[3]	3	2	0
1989	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in the town of Gelendzhik, in the Krasnodar Region. The applicant's husband was a staff member of the Oceanology Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a State-owned institution. In 1977 he was placed on a waiting list to receive housing. In August 1998 he was on the top of the list. In order to obtain a larger flat from the Institute, it was agreed that the applicant would transfer title to her own flat to the Institute. On 4 December 1998 the applicant and the Institute signed an exchange agreement. The Institute subsequently discovered that the applicant had sold her old flat in March 1998. On an unspecified date, having become aware of the above transactions, the Gelendzhik town prosecutor, acting on behalf of the Institute and the person who had been allocated the applicant's flat (a Mr M), brought proceedings against the applicant and her husband to have the exchange agreement invalidated and to evict the appli	[3]	2	2	0
1990	 The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in the Moscow Region. On 3 October 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking. On an unspecified date charges were brought against her and several other persons. On 5 October 2006 the Podolsk Town Court of the Moscow Region remanded her in custody. It referred to the gravity of the charge and found that she might abscond, reoffend, threaten witnesses, destroy evidence or impede the investigation in some other way. The applicant appealed. She submitted that she had no intention of absconding or interfering with the investigation and asked the court to release her on bail. She had a permanent place of residence and employment, positive references and a clean criminal record. On 31 October 2006 the Moscow Regional Court upheld the detention order on appeal, finding that it had been lawful and justified. There was a well-founded suspicion of the applicant’s involvement in drug trafficking	[1, 2]	1	2	0
1991	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Kyiv, Ukraine. The applicant had worked at a joint stock company, V., since 1968. On 4 November 1996 she was dismissed. On 29 November 1996 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Starokyivsky District Court of Kyiv against V., seeking reinstatement and payment of salary arrears still owed to her following her allegedly unlawful dismissal. On 28 January 1998 the court rejected the applicant’s claim as unsubstantiated. On 18 March 1998 the Kyiv City Court (since June 2001 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal), noting the lower court’s failure to examine the important pieces of evidence, quashed the judgment and remitted the case for fresh consideration. Of the eleven hearings held between 29 November 1996 and 18 March 1998 two were adjourned due to the applicant’s or her lawyer’s failure to appear before the court; four hearings were adjourned due to the defendant’s failure to appear before the cou	[3]	2	2	0
1992	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Kirovograd, Ukraine. On 16 November 2001, 6 March and 13 September 2002 the Leninskiy District Court of Kirovograd awarded the applicant 4,912.67 Ukrainian hryvnyas (UAH)[1], UAH 4,967.66[2] and UAH 6,025.10[3], respectively, in salary arrears and other payments due to her by her former employer, the Municipal Company “Garantiya” (комунальне підприємство «Гарантія») owned and controlled by the city council. All these judgments became final and the State Bailiffs’ Service instituted proceedings to enforce them. According to the Government, in the course of these proceedings the total amount of UAH 3,190.33 was paid to the applicant. According to the applicant, she had received UAH 2,366.02 only. Being dissatisfied with the lengthy non-enforcement of these judgments, the applicant instituted proceedings in the same court against the State Bailiffs’ Service, claiming compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary dam	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1993	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Kamyanets-Podilsky, Khmelnytsky region, Ukraine. On 20 August 2002 the local city council decided to put the applicant’s employer, Pharmacy No. 130 (комунальне підприємство Аптека № 130), a municipal enterprise owned and controlled by this council, into liquidation, and the liquidation proceedings were initiated. On 1 June 2004 the Kamyanets-Podilsky City Court awarded the applicant 1,355.41 Ukrainian hryvnyas (UAH)[1] in salary arrears and other payments due to her from Pharmacy No. 130. This judgment became final and on 2 September 2004 the State Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings. According to the Government, on 22 September 2004 the State Bailiffs’ Service, having terminated the enforcement proceedings, returned the writ of enforcement to the applicant on 22 September 2004. According to the Government, the applicant had been instructed to transfer the writ to the liquidation commis	[3, 9]	2	2	0
1994	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Košice. In 1997 the applicant’s parents, by way of a donation contract, transferred to the applicant their ownership title to a garage. On 13 March 2002 the applicant was sued by her parents. They asked the Košice I District Court to order the applicant to return the above gift. The applicant’s request for an interim measure was dismissed on 10 December 2002. Several hearings took place between 19 February 2003 and 29 July 2005. On 3 November 2005 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicant’s right under Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution to a hearing without unjustified delay and her right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a hearing within a reasonable time. It held that the case was not complex and the applicant’s conduct had not contributed to the length of the proceedings. The period of inactivity totalling one year was imputable to the District Court. The C	[3]	2	2	0
1995	 The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Bratislava. On 3 April 2002 the applicant lodged an action against her husband with the Bratislava IV District Court, seeking a judicial determination of their parental rights and obligations in respect of their child. On 30 January 2003 the District Court delivered an interim measure in the applicant’s favour. On 20 March 2003 the District Court gave the applicant custody of the child. It did not order the defendant to pay any maintenance. On 13 November 2003 the Bratislava Regional Court quashed the judgment in its part concerning maintenance and remitted the case to the District Court. The view was expressed that the court of first instance had not sufficiently established the relevant facts. The Regional Court ordered the District Court to proceed along the lines specified. In a judgment of 21 September 2004 the District Court determined the issue. On 23 September 2005 the Regional Court again quash	[3]	2	2	0
1996	 The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Hamburg. At the material time the applicant was working as a general practitioner in Hamburg. On 31 August 1993 the review board at the Hamburg Regional Medical Association (Prüfungsausschuss bei der Kassenärztliche Vereinigung Hamburg), after having examined the applicant’s economic efficiency (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below), decided to reduce by 15% the fees payable to her for the first quarter of 1993 and as far as initial check-ups were concerned. It argued that the fees claimed for her initial check-ups exceeded the average for that category by 72% and that there was thus a presumption of a lack of economic efficiency which the applicant had failed to rebut. Instead of 33,200 euros (EUR) the applicant was therefore awarded a reduced sum of EUR 32,200 in quarterly fees. By a letter dated 8 November 1993 the applicant lodged an administrative appeal. On 20 October 1994 the appeal boa	[3]	3	2	1
1997	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Odessa, Ukraine. At the material time the applicant worked at the Odessa Naval College (“the ONC”), a State educational institution. According to the applicant, in July 1990 her family was provided by the ONC with an apartment. However, she was not provided with any documents certifying her title to this apartment. In June 1997 the ONC instituted proceedings in the Zhovtnevy District Court of Odessa against the applicant, seeking eviction of her family. In this respect the ONC argued that the premises at issue were for administrative use only and that the applicant was occupying them without permission. The applicant lodged a counterclaim, seeking to acknowledge the habitable status of the disputed premises and her tenancy title thereto. She also sought to oblige the ONC to conclude a rent contract with her on the disputed premises. On 9 September 1997 the court joined the local city administration to the applic	[3]	2	2	0
1998	The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Munich, Germany. In 1996 the applicant entered into an agreement with a private company, Skorpion, under which the latter was obliged to construct an apartment in a block house. Following insolvency proceedings instituted against this company, the applicant entered into a debt transfer agreement (“the agreement”) with a private company, KGD, (“the company”), under which the latter accepted responsibility for the obligations of the Skorpion company. On 17 June 1999 the applicant instituted proceedings against the company in the Ivano-Frankivsk Court. She requested the court to declare a part of the agreement null and void and sought a ruling to oblige the company to fulfil the remainder of the agreement. On 6 September 1999 the Ivano-Frankivsk City Court (“the City Court”) allowed the applicant’s claim. On 16 November 1999 the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Court[1] quashed this decision and remitted the case for	[3]	2	2	0
1999	 The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Monastyryshche, Cherkassy region, Ukraine. On 31 May 2002, following complaints by several persons about the applicant, the local police launched an investigation into alleged fraud. The relevant decision begins as follows: “From 2000 to 2001 [the applicant], as the head of [a private company, N.], received money from [the listed persons] under the pretence [that she would provide them with] employment abroad, swindling and abusing their confidence, [...]”. Officially the applicant was not charged and participated in the proceedings as a witness. However, according to her, by January 2003 she had participated in a number of confrontations with victims. Furthermore, on 7 June 2002 her house had been searched by the authorities. From 4 July to 26 December 2002 the investigation was stayed eight times due to the applicant’s illness. Apparently no other investigative steps were taken during this period. Subsequently	[3]	2	2	0
2000	 The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Tula. In 1999 the applicant inherited a flat. On 19 August 1999 Mr L., the grandson of the testator, brought an action against the applicant seeking invalidation of the will and transfer of the title to the flat. Judge A. of the Zarechinskiy District Court of Tula adjourned the examination of the action until 10 October 1999, ordering Mr L. to pay a court fee. After the fee had been paid, the District Court fixed a preliminary hearing for 19 July 2000. At that hearing it ordered a post-mortem forensic psychiatric examination of the testator to establish whether she had been competent to make a will. The proceedings were stayed until 27 September 2000. According to the Government, the examination was not performed as the case file did not contain the materials necessary for the experts to carry out their inquiry. No hearings were held between October 2000 and 27 June 2001. On 27 June 2001 the case was as	[3]	3	2	0
2001	 The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Sofia. Following a petition from her former husband, on 29 October 1998 the Sofia District Court dissolved their marriage. It gave the applicant custody of the couple’s only child, and also gave her the use of the former matrimonial home. It found that this home was a flat acquired jointly by the former spouses during their marriage, situated in the “Strelbishte” neighbourhood of Sofia, and intended by them to fulfil the family’s housing needs (the applicant had moved into that flat in 1997 although it had not been fully finished). The fact that the applicant’s former husband had never lived there was of no relevance, as this had been the result of his disregarding his duty to co‑habit with his spouse. As the applicant had been given custody of their only child, the court held that she was entitled to use the flat. The applicant’s former husband appealed against the court order relating to the former matrimonial home. He	[]	2	2	0
2002	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Sofia. In 1967 her parents purchased from the Sofia municipality a two-room apartment of 69 square metres in the centre of the city. The apartment had become State property by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime in Bulgaria after 1947. After the deaths of her parents the applicant inherited from them. On 23 February 1993 the former pre-nationalisation owners of the apartment brought proceedings against the applicant under section 7 of the Restitution Law, seeking nullification of her title and restoration of their property. The proceedings ended by a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 5 March 2004. The courts declared the 1967 contract null and void and restored the plaintiffs’ title to the apartment on two grounds: 1) the initial decision to sell the apartment had not been affirmed by the Minister of Architecture and Public Works but by his deputy; and 2) the sale	[9]	2	2	0
2003	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Warszawa. On 9 June 1993 the applicant lodged with the Warszawa District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) an application for division of matrimonial property. She paid the relevant court fees on 9 November 1993. Between 9 June 1993 and 21 February 2003, the District Court scheduled 28 hearings, 6 of which were adjourned due to the failure of the applicant’s husband to appear; only two hearings were scheduled in 1996, no hearing was scheduled between 8 December 1997 and 15 June 1999 and two hearings were scheduled in 2000. On 5 March 2003 the Warszawa District Court delivered a partial decision (postanowienie częściowe) on the parties’ respective shares in the matrimonial property. Between 4 August 2004 and 16 April 2008, the District Court scheduled 13 hearings, 3 of which were adjourned. No hearing was held in 2006. On 23 June 2008 the Warszawa District Court gave a decision.

On 1 April 1999 Gazeta Wyborcza, a national newspaper, published an article reporting that two classical music programmes had been taken off the air. The article cited well-known composers, critics and journalists who had expressed their concerns about the lack of support for classical music and about the fact that the quality of public television programmes was being negatively affected as a result of fierce competition from private broadcasters. The article also quoted an opinion which had been expressed by the applicant in an interview in her capacity as the President of the Polish Public Television Journalists’ Union (Syndykat Dziennikarzy Polskich Telewizji Polskiej). The relevant part of the article read as follows: “... Ms Kaletowa, the President of the Polish Public Television Journalists’ Union 	[6]	3	2	0

On 4 August 1998 the Meidling District Court (Bezirksgericht), in summary proceedings, ordered the applicant to pay 102,330.48 Austrian schillings (ATS), approximately 7,440 euros (EUR) to G. for the cost of plumbing work carried out in her apartment (Zahlungsbefehl). On 26 May 1999 the District Court granted G.'s request for the enforcement of the payment of this order and the costs of the proceedings in the amount of approximately EUR 2,150 by judicial sale (Zwangsversteigerung) of the applicant's apartment situated at S.-street 23/17, in the 12th district of Vienna. That address was used by the courts for serving this and subsequent decisions. A registered letter was sent to the applicant at the above address. As it could not be handed over to her personally, it was served on her on 8 June 1999 by deposition (Hinterlegung) in the post office.

2015	 The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Limassol. The applicant claimed that in 1952, when she was 19 years' old, she had permanently settled in Famagusta (northern Cyprus), where she got married and had two sons. She had her home and other immovable property there. In order to substantiate her claim to ownership, the applicant produced an “affirmation of ownership of Turkish-occupied immovable property” issued by the Republic of Cyprus, according to which her properties could be described as follows: - Famagusta, Chrysi Akti, plot no. 778, block C, sheet/plan 33/21.1.IV, description: buildings with house, yard and shop on ground floor and house on the first floor; use: residence; area of the houses: 115 m² each; share: ¾.

2018	 The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Chişinău. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant worked as a carpet maker for Floare-Carpet SA, a company registered in Chişinău (“the employer”). On 29 November 1999 she was declared to be a person with second degree disabilities by a specialised medical commission, which recommended that the applicant should stop working as a carpet maker as her working conditions were damaging her health. Having submitted the relevant certificate to her employer, on 30 December 1999 the applicant was dismissed from her job on the grounds that she was no longer able to work as a result of her invalidity. She disagreed with the reason for her dismissal, claiming that this was not a valid legal reason. She asked her employer to issue her with a record of employment (carnet de muncă) giving a different reason for her dismissal, a document which she would have to produce i	[3]	2	2	0
2019	 On 31 July 1996 the applicant was run over by a motorist, Mr A.I. As a result of the accident, her clothes were damaged and became unusable. Both of her arms, her right ear and her right leg were bruised. Shortly after that she was admitted to a hospital, where she spent a week, and was found to have a broken ankle and a traumatic brain injury. After criminal proceedings which were later converted to administrative-penal ones, in a judgment of 10 March 1997 the Sofia District Court found A.I. responsible for the accident and fined him. On 4 June 1997 the applicant brought a civil action against A.I. and his insurer. She sought 500,000 old Bulgarian levs (BGL)[1] for pecuniary and BGL 2,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage. Between October 1997 and March 1999 the Sofia District Court held ten hearings, the first five of which were adjourned because A.I. had not been properly summoned.

The Government claimed that the proceedings started on an unspecified date in 1997. In October 1997 she moved to another town. According to her, she informed the court of her new address. On 24 November 1997 the District Court decided to process her pecuniary claims separately. By a judgment of 25 November 1997, the District Court ordered the applicant’s reinstatement in her post and awarded her 500,000 Russian roubles 	[3]	2	2	0
2021	 The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Bucharest. At the material time she was a judge in a first-instance court in Bucharest. Two sets of criminal investigations were started against her, on suspicion of having repeatedly falsified official documents in the exercise of her duties, as part of an organised group, with the aim of illegally obtaining title to various properties in the centre of Bucharest. Under the provisions of Law no. 92/1992 on the Organisation of Justice, the applicant was automatically suspended from her post during the criminal trial. On 18 September 2001 she was dismissed from her post by an order of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary (Consiliul Superior al Magistraturii) for manifest professional unfitness. On 15 July 2003 the decision was endorsed by the President of the Republic and on 3 November 2003 it was upheld by the High Court of Cassation and Justice (former Supreme Court of Justice), upon an appeal by the applicant.

On 10 January 2001 the Grigoriopol District Court allowed the claims made by the plaintiffs in part. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final fifteen days later. The applicant sought enforcement of the judgment and claims that a number of measures were taken with a view to having it enforced. In a letter signed 30 November 2001 (but apparently lodged with the court on 6 December 2001) L. appealed against the judgment of 10 January 2001. L. claimed that it had not received a copy of the judgment until the middle of November. The representative for the applicant and the other five plaintiffs asked 	[3]	2	2	0
2023	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Poznań. The applicant lives in a rented flat in a house in Poznań. In 1995 a certain M.W. converted an attic above the applicant's flat into a flat and, without the required permit, moved in. She failed to carry out the necessary soundproofing work and, as a result, the applicant could be heard from her flat and is disturbed by noise coming from the flat above her. In 1995 the applicant instituted administrative proceedings. She sought a demolition order in relation to the unauthorised flat. On 28 June 1998 the mayor of Poznań gave a decision ordering the compulsory demolition “of the constituent elements of the flat” and imposing on the co-owners of the building an obligation to restore the attic to its former condition (przywrócenie stanu poprzedniego). On an unspecified date the co-owners of the building and M.W. appealed against that decision. On 24 September 1998 the Poznań Gover	[3]	2	2	0
2024	 The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Yekaterinburg. At the material time she was a journalist and the editor-in-chief of the newspaper D.S.P. (“D.S.P.” is a Russian abbreviation meaning “For Official Use Only”).

The first article, entitled “Gay scandal in the White House” (“Гей-скандал в «Белом доме»”), appeared under the name of “Sergey Petrov”. It opened with the following passage: “Once upon a time there lived the head of the Sverdlovsk Regional Government Mr V. He had everything: his position, high esteem and respect. And also the governor's love. But V. fell in love ... not with the governor or with his work, but with a twenty	[6]	2	2	0
2025	 The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Dortmund. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1992 the applicant and her husband transferred the ownership of a flat to the applicant's niece. In the notarial deed they agreed upon a life annuity in the amount of 400 German marks (DEM) and a “purchase price” of DEM 53,000. Prior to the drawing up of the notarial deed both parties had moreover agreed that the niece was not entitled to sell the flat to a third party. In 1995, after the parties' relationship had deteriorated, the applicant's niece sold the flat. In March 1996 the applicant and her husband therefore revoked the transfer of ownership, which they had considered a gift, on account of the recipient's gross ingratitude. On 9 January 1997 the applicant and her husband introduced a claim against the niece with the Dortmund Regional Court for the payment of DEM 137,000. At a hearing of 18 Ap	[3]	3	2	1
2026	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Moscow. On 8 October 2004 the applicant travelled from Moscow to Simferopol in Ukraine through Sheremetyevo airport.

The customs inspection uncovered the remaining USD 3,020, which the applicant claimed she had forgotten about. She was charged with smuggling, a criminal offence under Article 188 § 1 of the Criminal Code. The money was appended to the criminal case as physical evidence (вещественные доказательства). On 9 December 2004 the Golovinskiy District Court of Moscow found the applicant guilty as charged and imposed a suspended sentence of one year's imprisonment, conditional on one year's probation. As regards the money, it referred to Article 81 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and held that: “Physical evidence – USD 13,020 and UAH 31 h	[9]	1	2	0

2029	 The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in Krasnodar. In October 1996 the applicant's husband sued his neighbours, Mr P and Mr Pr alleging that they prevented him from using his land. In April 1997 he amended his claim raising a complaint against the Krasnodar town administration claiming removal of structures built on his land and annulment of the administration's decision allowing such construction. In reply to the court's request, in his report dated 31 March 1997, the expert concluded that the border between P's and the applicant's land was not in line with the reference document issued in 1957. By a default judgment of 23 January 1998, the Pervomayskiy District Court of Krasnodar granted the applicant's husband's claims. Mr P sought annulment of the default judgment.

The liquidation proceedings instituted against the company are still pending. The judgment of 20 February 2004 has not been enforced due to the company's lack of funds.	[9]	2	2	0
2033	 On 19 January 1990 the Józefów Municipality Representative approved an initial development project (plan zabudowy) and permitted the construction of a house on a plot of land adjacent to that of the applicant. On 29 May 1992 the applicant’s neighbour was ordered by the authorities to demolish some of the appurtenances (including an outhouse) that had been built without a permit. On 26 April 1993 a building permit for a cesspit was issued to the neighbour. The applicant appealed in writing against the construction of the cesspit, as it was to be placed close to where she lived. She also did not agree to the construction of an outhouse on the neighbouring plot. On 31 October 1996 the Józefów Municipality Representative ordered the demolition of the outhouse, as it had been built unlawfully and had been contested by the applicant.

2038	 The applicant was born in 1936. At the time of the introduction of her application she was living in Larnaca. In 1996 the Cyprus Motorcycle Federation (CMF) organised a demonstration aimed at protesting against the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus. On 2 August 1996 a group of over one hundred Cypriot and other European motorcyclists set off from Berlin and made their way through Europe to Cyprus. Tensions arose when the authorities of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (the “TRNC”) announced that, should the demonstration take place, they would be organising “counter-rallies”. The President of the Republic of Cyprus made a special plea to the motorcyclists to disperse peacefully. Notwithstanding this, on 11 August 1996 a group of motorcyclists and other civilians proceeded to various points along the United Nations (UN) buffer zone. Violent clashes took place between the demonstrators, the counter-demonstrators and the “TRNC” forces. One o	[0]	3	2	0

On 29 January 2000, following the outbreak of armed conflict in Chechnya, Yusup Satabayev joined one of the paramilitary groups which fought against the federal army. According to the applicant, he stayed with the paramilitary group for less than a month, during which time there were no armed confrontations, and then left. On 23 February 2000 he arrived in Martan-Chu, in the Urus-Martan district, allegedly to surrender to the authorities in order to benefit from the Amnesty Act. However, on the same day he was arrested at his sister's house by servicemen of the Federal Security Service (FSB).

2040	 The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Szczecin. In the early hours on 2 June 2001 the applicant and her friend J.D. were coming back from a party in Cracow. At a certain point they stopped because the applicant wanted to collect some leaves from an oak tree; she is a painter and she needed them to produce dye for her work. As they approached the tree, a police car stopped near them. Two uniformed policemen got out of the car and asked the applicant and her friend what they were doing there. The applicant asked what she was suspected of and what the policemen wanted from her. She asked them to show their badges. The policemen refused. Then the applicant and her friend were asked to show their identity cards. J.D. did not have his identity card on him; however, he gave the policemen his personal details. The applicant refused, saying that she did not have her card on her and that she did not trust the Polish police. Then she said that she would not speak to th	[]	2	2	0
2041	 The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Piešťany. On 31 December 1992 the applicant filed an action with the Nitra District Court. Under the Land Ownership Act 1991 she claimed compensation for agricultural property and livestock which had been transferred to a co-operative in 1951. In March 1997, January 2002 and May 2005 issues of a procedural nature were determined by the court of appeal. In September 2007 the Government informed the Court that the proceedings were pending before the District Court. No information is available about further developments in the case. On 30 December 2005 the Constitutional Court found that the District Court had violated the applicant's right to a hearing without unjustified delay. The decision stated that the proceedings had been pending for 12 years. During that period not a single hearing had been held with a view to taking evidence and establishing the facts relevant for the determination of the applicant	[3]	2	2	0
2042	 The applicant was born in 1925 and lives in Bratislava. In 1938 the applicant's father acquired land in Levoča. After the Second World War, when the communist regime was installed in Czechoslovakia, the State availed itself of the land and put it at the disposal of a State-owned agricultural farm in Levoča without the owner's consent and without paying any compensation. The applicant's father remained the owner of the land in name (nuda proprietas). In 1983 the farm put the land, of which the applicant and her four sisters had become the owners in the meantime, at the disposal of the local organisation of the Slovak Union of Gardeners in Levoča for ten years. The owners were provided with no compensation. In accordance with the provisions of the Land Ownership Act 1991, the gardeners' right to use the land was extended by ten years in 1993. Levoča is nowadays a district town with approximately 15,000 inhabitants. According to the data in the lan	[9]	3	2	0
2043	 The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Belozem. On 12 November 1997 the applicant, who had previous convictions for rape and other offences, was arrested, charged with rape and sexual assault and remanded in custody. The charges on which the applicant was later convicted concerned a gang rape by three persons who entered the home of a woman who lived with her two minor daughters, forced her to leave the house and raped the girls, aged thirteen and sixteen. The preliminary investigation was completed in July 1998. During that stage of the proceedings the investigator held more than twenty interviews with witnesses and the accused, commissioned medical reports and a psychiatric report, conducted searches and collected other evidence. On 31 July 1998 an indictment was submitted to the Plovdiv District Court. In the following two years and two months the District Court invited the parties to ten or twelve hearings, five or six of which were adjo	[3]	2	2	0
2044	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Otwock. On an unspecified date in January 1987 the applicant's former husband instituted civil proceedings for division of matrimonial property. During the proceedings the Otwock District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided on several occasions, of its own motion, to stay the proceedings due to the fact that the plaintiff had not paid the relevant costs arising in the course of the proceedings. On numerous occasions the applicant requested the court to resume the proceedings and to proceed speedily with the claim. On 5 March 1998 the applicant complained to the President of the Warsaw Regional Court (Prezes Sądu Wojewódzkiego) about the delay in the proceedings. On 8 April 2004 the proceedings were resumed. On 20 October 2006 the Otwock District Court gave a decision ordering the plaintiff to pay a certain amount to the applicant. The applicant appealed. On 29 October 2007 the War	[3]	2	2	0
2045	 The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Nicosia. The applicant lived in her family home in Lapithos (the biggest village in the Kyrenia district of northern Cyprus) until 1963, when she married and moved to her husband's house in a neighbouring village. Her mother came from Sysklipos, another village near Lapithos, where she owned land. The applicant claimed to have acquired the ownership of the family property in the two villages, as well as a right to draw a certain amount of water from a spring in Sysklipos. The Government challenged the applicant's property claims, particularly as regarded the properties in Sysklipos, as they had evidence that it had belonged to other persons. The applicant replied that those other persons were her parents who had donated these properties to her. On 27 November 1973 the applicant applied to the Kyrenia Land Registry Office for a permit to divide one of her plots of land in Lapithos into sixteen building sites. Sh	[9]	3	2	0
2046	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Frankfurt. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is the mother of a child born on 23 January 1996. In 2004, after having obtained an expert opinion, a court transferred custody to her and at the same time determined the father's access rights. On 17 August 2007, following a three-week stay with her father, the child refused to go back to her mother, and, on account of this, was taken into care. On 20 August 2007 the applicant requested the court to return the child to her custody. On 21 August 2007 the Frankfurt/Main District Court (the “District Court”), by means of an interlocutory decision, made at the request of the Frankfurt/Main Youth Office, transferred the right to determine the child's residence and other essential aspects of custody to the Frankfurt/Main Youth Office.

2047	 In 1979 the applicant purchased a one-third share in certain real estate in Neštěnice which had been donated to the State by the original owners in 1966. The purchase price of 25,326 Czech korunas (CZK) (950 euros (EUR)[1]) for the whole property was fixed by an expert in September 1978. At the time the application was lodged the property was being used by the applicant's daughter and her family. On 25 August 1992, after the entry into force of Act no. 229/1991 (“the Land Ownership Act”), a certain M. instituted restitution proceedings in the Benešov District Court (okresní soud) against five co-owners, including the applicant, seeking recovery of the property in issue by virtue of section 8 (1) of the Land Ownership Act. M. alleged that the acquisition of the property by the applicant and the other co-owners had been vitiated by a breach of the regulations in force at the time, that they had enjoyed an unlawful advantage, and that the price they had been required	[9]	0	2	0
2048	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Achkhoy-Martan, Chechnya. She is the mother of Balavdi Ustarkhanov, who was born in 1982. The events described in the application took place in Zakan-Yurt, in the Achkhoy-Martan district of Chechnya. At the material time the village of Zakan-Yurt was under the full control of the Russian federal forces. Military checkpoints manned by Russian servicemen were located on the roads leading to and from the settlement. The area was under a curfew. At the material time the applicant and her son Balavdi Ustarkhanov lived in Achkhoy-Martan, Chechnya. On 31 December 2002 Balavdi Ustarkhanov went to Zakan-Yurt to celebrate the New Year holiday with his friend, Mr Magomed M.

2049	 The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Arkhangelsk. In 1975 the applicant was injured in a work-related accident. In 2004 she sued the Arkhangelsk Regional Health Department for disability benefits alleging that her current disability had resulted from that incident. On 15 December 2004 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Arkhangelsk rejected the applicant's claims. The District Court examined, among other evidence, a decision by the Medical and Labour Expert Examination Service of the Arkhangelsk Region, which indicated that the applicant's disability had been caused by the injury she sustained in 1975. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Arkhangelsk Regional Court. The appeal hearing was scheduled for 17 January 2005. According to the Government, the District Court dispatched summonses to the parties, including the applicant and her representative, informing them of the date and time of the appeal hearing.

2050	 The applicant, Ms Janina Trzaskalska, is a Polish national who was born in 1955 and lives in Częstochowa. She owned a plot of land which was expropriated by a decision of 5 May 1988 for the purposes of building a housing estate. By virtue of the same decision the applicant received compensation for one plot amounting to 1,121.299 old Polish zlotys (PLZ). By a supplementary decision of 8 June 1988 the Częstochowa Municipal Office fixed the amount of compensation for another plot at PLZ 560,649. On 29 January 1990 and 19 April 1990 the Municipal Office fixed the amounts of compensation for two remaining expropriated plots at PLZ 236,073.600 and PLZ 119,817.600, respectively. On 30 January 1997 the applicant filed a motion with the President of the Urban Development Office to declare the expropriation decision of 1988 null and void. She claimed that the compensation was too low, as the authorities had calculated it on the basis of agricultural land, whereas after the	[3]	2	2	0
2051	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Cracow. In a letter of 18 September 2000 to the Social Insurance Authority (Zaklad Ubezpieczeń Spolecznych) in Cracow, the applicant's husband submitted that in his view the applicant, who had been receiving a disability pension since 1985, was in fact healthy and should no longer be receiving a pension. He suggested that she be re-examined by competent doctors. Apparently divorce proceedings involving the parties were pending at that time. On 10 October 2000 the Social Insurance Authority, referring to the applicant's medical records, instituted proceedings in order to reassess the applicant's condition with a view to establishing whether she complied with the conditions governing entitlement to a disability pension. In reply to a query from the applicant about the legal basis on which these proceedings were instituted, on 28 November 2000 the Social Insurance Authority informed her that the proceedings had bee	[3]	2	2	0
2052	 The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Tampere. On 16 June 2001 the police searched the applicant's apartment on account of a suspicion that it had been used for procuring. On 26 June 2001 she was questioned as a suspect. On 11 August 2001 the pre-trial investigation was completed. On 23 August 2001 the public prosecutor preferred charges against the applicant for procuring, allegedly committed during the period from 4 to 11 June 2001. On an unspecified date the applicant was summoned to appear before the Tampere District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) at a hearing which was to take place on 6 March 2002. However, the hearing was cancelled owing to the fact that Ms H., a witness, had failed to appear before the court although lawfully summoned to do so. Another witness, Ms M., had not been summoned. Both witnesses were Estonian citizens. The hearing of the case was postponed until 12 August 2002 and Ms H. was summoned to appear before the	[3]	2	2	1
2053	 The applicant, Mr Lulzim Caka, was born in 1970 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Tirana, Albania. On 21 July 1997 P. was murdered. On an unspecified date in 1997 a criminal investigation was opened against the applicant. During the criminal investigation, the victim's sister, A., even though she had not been present at the crime scene, stated that the applicant had killed her brother. She based her testimony on the account of three eyewitnesses, B., C. and D., who, it would appear, were questioned on an unspecified date. On 6 October 1998 the judicial police, the body responsible for the conduct of the criminal investigation and the identification of the perpetrator, recommended that the criminal investigation be suspended, as the perpetrator of the crime could not be identified. However, on 15 October 1998 the prosecutor filed an indictment against the applicant with the Berat District Court (see paragraph 17 below). In 1997 Albania was hit 	[3]	2	2	1

On 21 December 1992 the applicant was informed that the ordinary courts had jurisdiction to deal with her claim. On 11 June 1993 the applicant filed an inheritance-related claim with the Bratislava-vidiek District Court (whose case load was later transferred to the Bratislava III District Court). On 4 October 1993 the District Court stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of related inheritance proceedings. The related proceedings were concluded on 20 November 1996. On 19 June 2006 the Bratislava III District Court delivered a judgment. On 22 August 2006 the applicant appealed. On 20 September 2007 the Bratislava Regional Court, without deciding on the merits, returned the case to the District Court to rectify errors in its judgment.

On 28 January 2004 the Shevchenkivskiy District Court of Kyiv obliged the Shevchenkivskiy District Administration of Kyiv to regularise privatisation of the apartment, which the applicant occupied with her family. On 13 May 2004 this judgment was upheld by the Kyiv City Court of Appeal and on 27 July 2004 the bailiff service instituted enforcement proceedings in its respect. On 9 December 2004 the judgment was further upheld by the Supreme Court of Ukraine and became final. On several occasions the enforcement proceedings were suspended on account of various objections and requests for clarification by the debtor. On 17 and 23 February 2005 the bailiffs' service imposed fines on the Head of the Administration on account of his failure to ensure enforcement of the judgment. In March 2005 the bailiffs' service further requested the prosecutors' office to institute criminal proceedings against him on	[3, 9]	2	2	0
2056	 The applicant who was born in India lives in Lustenau. She runs an Indian restaurant with Ayurvedic cuisine in Lustenau. On 1 October 2004 she lodged a request with the Dornbirn Labour Market Service (Arbeitsmarktservice – LMS) for the grant of an employment permit for an Ayurvedic chef from the South of India as a key worker (Schlüsselarbeitskraft). On 2 November 2004 the Dornbirn LMS refused the request in accordance with section 2(5) of the Aliens' Employment Act (Ausländerbeschäftigungsgesetz). It found that the chef did not fulfil the conditions to be a key worker as defined in section 2(5). The applicant appealed against the refusal to the Vorarlberg LMS on 17 November 2004. She maintained in substance that the authority had failed to assess properly the evidence. On 15 February 2005 the Vorarlberg LMS dismissed the applicant's appeal. It held that the submitted documents did not sufficiently prove her contention that the proposed chef fulf	[3]	0	2	1
2057	 The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in the town of Biysk in the Altayskiy Region. The applicant stated that the residents of her block of flats were embroiled in a conflict with a group of teenagers who frequently gathered in front of the building to drink alcohol, litter the yard and make noise until late at night. On 24 August 1999 several residents, including the applicant and her partner Mr Sh., tried to disperse the teenagers. A quarrel followed. One of the teenagers swore at them. Mr Sh. retorted that “youngsters like these should be killed”. The teenagers ran immediately to the nearby police station where they complained that Mr Sh. had threatened them with a gun and had fired a shot at them. Several minutes later several police officers came running to the spot and required that Mr Sh. surrender his gun. They were drunk. Mr Sh. denied having a gun. The applicant told him to go home and he left. The policemen did not attempt to stop him. 	[0]	3	2	0
2058	 The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in the town of Voronezh. The applicant was a member of a housing cooperative. Having paid a sum of money, she expected to receive a certain flat from the cooperative in a newly built block of flats. However, the applicant was then expelled from the cooperative. The flat was given to Mr L instead. The latter sold the flat to Mr Ch. On 16 March 1998 the applicant brought proceedings against the housing cooperative in the Kominternovskiy District Court of Voronezh. She sought the annulment of the cooperative's decision to expel her and give the flat to L. She also sought compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage and recognition of her title to the flat. In the meantime, Mr Ch resold the flat to Ms K. On 7 May 1998 the judge issued a charging order in respect of the flat. In September 1998 the applicant amended her claims, seeking the annulment of the purchase contracts by Ch and K and recognition of her	[3]	3	2	0
2059	 The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Zlatar. In July 1991 the applicant had a road traffic accident. Since the insurance company C.O.

On 15 March 1993 the Municipal Court ruled in the applicant's favour ordering the company to pay her the amount of 222,501 Croatian dinars (HRD) together with the statutory default interest accruable from 19 August 1991. The applicant collected the judgment debt on 16 July 1993. However, in the meantime, on 2 July 1993 the Municipal Court issued a decision rectifying a clerical error in its judgment of 15 March 1993. Instead of ordering the company to pay the statutory default interest accruable from 19 August 1991 on the entire amount of damages awarded, (HRD 222,501), in the rectified judgment the court ordered the company to do so only on the	[3]	2	2	0

Subsequently, the applicant sued Mr T. and the Krasnodar Town Council, seeking annulment of their title to the ramshackle buildings adjacent to the house. On 18 June 2003 the Justice of the Peace in the 64th Circuit of the Tsentralniy District of Krasnodar granted her claims. No appeal was lodged. In 2004 Mr T. applied for supervisory review of the judgments of 1 March 2001 and 18 June 2003. On 12 February 2004 the Presidium of the Krasnodar Regional Court quashed the judgment of 18 June 2003 because the Justice of the Peace had misapplied the domestic law.

On 29 December 1992 the applicant's husband bought municipal property, including the premises of a former restaurant. According to the applicant, several years later her husband, fearing for his life and for the safety of his family, signed a contract with a number of individuals, transferring title to the restaurant building to them. On 5 May 2002 the applicant, in the interests of her minor child, lodged an action against her husband, seeking invalidation of the contract. She claimed that her husband had acted ultra vires while signing the contract, as he had not been the sole owner of the building. A part of the building had belonged to their minor child. The Sverdlovskiy District Court of Belgorod accepted the claim for examination and listed a hearing.  However, on 13 August 2002 it transferred the case to the Commercial Court of the Belgorod Region for further a	[3]	2	2	0

On 21 November 2001 the applicant was served with that judgment together with its written grounds. On 10 December 2001 she filed a request with the Słupsk Regional Court to be granted a legal-aid lawyer for the purpose of lodging a cassation appeal. Her request was subsequently forwarded to the Gdańsk Court of Appeal as the Słupsk court lacked jurisdiction to deal with it. The request was allowed by a decision of 17 December 2001.

2065	 The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Bratislava. In 1964 the applicant’s grandfather died and inheritance proceedings were instituted. On 12 January 1966 the State Notary approved the inheritance settlement. In the settlement the applicant’s mother waived her right to a share of the estate although her legal capacity was restricted. An apartment in which she lived with the applicant was included in the estate. In 1983 the property in issue was confiscated by the State. In 1991 the heirs under the inheritance settlement of 1966 applied for the property in restitution proceedings, signed a restitution agreement and became owners of the property. On 17 August 1992 the applicant requested the State Notary Bratislava I that the inheritance settlement be served on her.

On 9 December 1997 the employer dismissed the applicant, considering her complaint as a request for resignation. The applicant's objection remained undecided. On 26 February 1998 she claimed before the Skopje Court of First Instance (“the first-instance court”) annulment of the dismissal decision, her reinstatement and payment of unpaid salary. On 17 February 1999 the court ordered expert examination of the applicant's mental state of health on 27 November 1997, the date when she had submitted her complaints to the employer. The applicant was ordered to pay the expert fees within fifteen days. On 12 June 2000 the first-instance court noted that the applicant had failed to pay the fees.

Two charges were brought against her: threatening to kill, and assaulting, a certain J. B.-D. The prosecutor requested that 12 witnesses be heard. On 12 January 2000 the applicant requested that the case be transferred to the Kraków District Court. She further requested that all the judges of the Olkusz District Court be excluded from the examination of her case. It appears that both applications were dismissed. On 4 September 2000 the applicant lodged an application requesting the hearing to be recorded on tape; this was also dismissed. The first hearing in the case took place on 5 October 2000.

The applicant's husband rented a new flat and started hindering the applicant's contact with her son. In February 2006 the applicant filed for divorce. On 24 May 2006 the Białystok District Court (Sąd Okręgowy) gave an interim order which stipulated that, during the divorce proceedings, the child's place of residence would be with the applicant.

By letter dated 12 October 2009 the head of the investigation (tutkinnanjohtaja, undersökningsledaren) informed the applicant that the seizure of the data had not been successful due to the fact that the wrong files had been copied, and that the information copied had been destroyed. The applicant allegedly never received a copy of the seized files so it was not possible to verify whether the seizure of the data really had been unsuccessful. The seized documents remained in the police's possession. The pre-trial investigation has been concluded and the case 	[4]	2	2	1

In a criminal case in which the applicant was accused of causing minor bodily harm to a certain D.Ł., in the context of a long‑running neighbourhood dispute between them, the applicant requested that judges of the Elbląg Regional Court be disqualified from dealing with her case. She indicated that D.Ł. was the brother of Judge M.K.P., a supervising judge at that court. By a decision of 17 May 2000 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal allowed her request and transferred the case to the Włocławek District Court. It was of the view that those judges of the Elbląg Regional Court who had declared that they knew the victim of the alleged offence personally could not sit in the case as it would cast doubt on their impartiality. Similarly, the judges of that court who had not made such a declaration should be disqualified, as the existence of a link between the victim of the alleged offence and the supervising judge justified the 	[3]	2	2	0

On 30 December 2005 the investigator accused the applicant of having damaged the patient’s health. On 23 February 2006 a public prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s complaint against that decision. Between 11 May 2006 and 6 June 2006 three institutions informed the investigator that they were not in a position to review the expert’s opinion for various reasons. On 13 June 2006 the investigator heard three witnesses. On 28 August 2006 the investigator appointed a different institution with a view to obtaining a second expert opinion. 	[3]	2	2	0

She told her creditors that she would use the money to import cosmetic products from a French company to sell in her cosmetics shop in Chişinău. However, she did not repay the money and interest within the time-limits agreed with her creditors. The applicant submitted that she had repaid part of her debt before the proceedings against her were initiated and that the delay in repaying the debt was due to delays in importing the cosmetic products to Moldova. It is not disputed by the parties that the applicant never denied the existence of her debts and that she confirmed them in writing and before the authorities during the criminal	[1, 3]	2	2	0

It involved the applicant – who is of Roma origin – and another fifty people. After a first visit at 8.30 p.m. without any incident, at about 9.30 p.m. several police officers returned to the house, demanding that the music be turned down. Those present complied. Subsequently, a heated argument started between a Mr H. and a police officer. The applicant intervened, a tumultuous scene developed, and the officer called the applicant names. The officer, threatening her with arrest, grabbed her arm and pepper-sprayed her eyes. The Government submitted that this had been necessitated by the applicant’s resistance. The applicant fell over, and then six or seven male officers dragged her on the ground to, and banged her against, the police car.

On 30 November 1995 a mother brought her daughter, V., born in 1993, to the applicant’s practice to be examined, suspecting that the girl had been sexually abused by her father. The applicant examined her and took photographs. On 13 June 2000 the girl was taken into public care because of her mother’s mental health problems and was placed in a family support centre. The events now in issue began on 16 December 2000, when the mother failed to return V. to the family support centre after spending time with her. It appears that the centre was going to close during the Christmas holidays and it was alleged during the domestic proceedings that the girl had indicated to her mother that she was unwilling to go to her father’s home for the holidays.

In 2007 there was a public debate in the print and televised media in Iceland on whether the regulations pertaining to strip clubs should be made stricter or whether such clubs should be banned. In June 2007 a magazine named Ísafold published an article discussing the links between such clubs and prostitution. It maintained that the conditions of strip club dancers originating from eastern Europe could be compared to human trafficking as defined in the relevant United Nations instruments. Subsequently, Vikan published in its issue no. 31 interviews with three east European women who worked at a strip club called Goldfinger owned by Mr Y. They had stated that they were happy working for Mr Y and that the critical remarks made about strip clubs could only be explained by the envy of c	[6]	2	2	1

2299	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Pécel. The applicant was a civil servant working in the service of an administrative inspectorate. Applying Act no. LVIII of 2010 on the Legal Status of Government Officials (see below), her employer dismissed her from service on 27 September 2010 without giving any reasons for that dismissal. The applicant did not challenge this measure in court, considering that in the absence of reasons for her dismissal, she could not sue her former employer with any prospect of success. The statutory time-limit in this respect expired on 26 October 2010. On 18 February 2011 the Constitutional Court annulled as unconstitutional the impugned section 8(1) of Act no. LVIII of 2010, as of 31 May 2011 (see paragraph 16 below). On 6 May 2011 the Constitutional Court gave a decision (see paragraph 17 below) concerning the non-applicability of laws, declared unconstitutional, in cases still pending before an ordinary court.

From January 1981 onwards she had a contract of indefinite duration and worked as a photographer at the embassy. Following an accident in 1983 the competent authority issued a decision stating that she qualified for protection under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act (Invaliden­einstellungs­gesetz). Following a further accident, classified as work-related, the embassy dismissed her in September 1987. Her dismissal was declared void by the Vienna Labour and Social Court (Arbeits- und Sozialgericht) on the ground that it required the prior agreement of the competent authority under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act. The court dismissed the argument submitted by the United States that it lacked jurisdiction on account of the United States’ immunity. It found that, while foreign States enjoyed immunity	[3]	3	2	1

2303	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Szczecin. The applicant was involved in two sets of civil proceedings for payment pending before the Szczecin District Court. In one of them she was a defendant and in another she represented her mother, H.K. On 7 June 2007 the applicant submitted her pleadings in the second case to the Szczecin District Court. She argued that her mother had not given any grounds on which to institute execution proceedings against her, because she had already paid the amounts awarded to the plaintiff. She stated that the efforts to have that judgment executed was a result of “criminal activity of a group of persons acting with a view to intimidating, threatening and extorting money from [H.K.] and from the applicant and her family and threatening H.K.’s life. This amounted to a real danger to H.K, as she was 89 years old and in poor health. This group of a criminal nature was composed of [lawyer] D.N. acting in a corrupt mafia-like setup	[]	2	2	0

It sought a judgment obliging her to sell to the co-operative a number of plots of land which had been de facto occupied by the co-operative for a long period of time. By a judgment of 16 June 2003 the Opole Regional Court dismissed the claim. It held that the applicable provisions of the Housing Co‑operatives Act provided for an obligatory sale of land occupied de facto by housing co-operatives only where a co-operative had erected buildings thereon. In the present case, the plaintiff co-operative had built roads and parking areas on the land concerned. The plaintiff co‑operative appealed.

2312	 The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Košice. In 2000 a cooperative sued the applicant’s mother for termination of a tenancy agreement in respect of a flat in which she lived with the applicant and the latter’s daughter. It was argued that the tenant had failed to pay the rent and service charges. In her reply the defendant explained that she was an immobile invalid, and that her daughter had taken care of her for twenty years and was unemployed. They were in financial need and unable to pay the rent. The defendant authorised the applicant to represent her at hearings before the Košice I District Court on 15 January 2002 and 17 May 2002. Subsequently, the District Court examined the case in the presence of the applicant who attended hearings but had no authority to represent her mother.

By virtue of the Decree of 6 September 1944 on Agrarian Reform (“the 1944 Decree”) ownership of private agricultural properties exceeding 50 hectares was transferred ex lege to the State. In 1974 the State transferred ownership of the property to a State-owned company Delta-Mielec. In the same year an entry confirming that company’s right of perpetual use in respect of the property was made in the land register. After the collapse of the communist regime the applicant and other legal successors of the former owners instituted proceedings seeking to have the ownership restored to them. On 23 November 2000 the applicant instituted administrative proceedings. She requested the Podkarpackie Governor (Wojewoda Podkarpacki) to give a decision declaring the expropriation null and void.

The proceedings were conducted before the Domžale Local Court sitting in a formation of a single judge. The judge in the case was Judge M., a Ljubljana Higher Court judge who had been temporarily appointed to the local court. It appears from the transcript of the hearing of 28 November 2001 that the applicant was not permitted to ask the defendant certain questions as they were considered suggestive by Judge M. Her proposal that a witness be heard was also rejected, as this evidence was not considered necessary by the judge. On 28 November 2001 the Domžale Local Court delivered a judgment rejecting M.Š.’s claim for compensation. On 27 December 2001 the applicant’s client appealed. In the a	[3]	2	2	0

On 3 February 2006 the Saky Prosecutor’s Office (Сакська міжрайонна прокуратура) instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant for abuse of a position of power, allegedly committed between June 2004 and July 2005. On 6 February 2006 the investigating officer of the Saky Prosecutor’s Office, referring to Articles 106 and 115 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine, decided that the applicant should be arrested and placed in the Saky Temporary Detention Centre (ізолятор тимчасового тримання) (hereinafter “the ITT”) because “witnesses in the criminal case had identified the applicant as a person who had committed a crime for 	[1, 2]	2	2	0

On 1 April 2004 criminal proceedings were instituted against her for allegedly attempting to bribe a judge and for fraud. On the same day the applicant was arrested. On 3 April 2004 the Dnipropetrovsk Prosecutor’s Office asked the court to order the applicant’s pre-trial detention arguing that the applicant might escape since she had the financial means to do so and a special passport issued for travelling abroad (закордонний паспорт) which she had already used on several occasions. There was also a possibility that she could hinder the investigation, put pressure on witnesses and destroy documentary evidence. The applicant already had a criminal record (it appears from the material in the case file that in 2000 she was charged on several counts of fraud but was pardoned in an amnesty). The applicant did not appear to have a permanent place of residence as she had provi	[2]	2	2	0
2385	 The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in İzmir. Following her marriage to Atila Abdulkadiroğlu on 6 July 1996, the applicant, whose surname was “Leventoğlu” prior to her marriage, had to take her husband’s surname pursuant to Article 153 of the Turkish Civil Code. As she was known by her maiden name in her academic and professional life, she continued to use it; however, she could not use it in any official documents. An amendment to Article 153 of the Civil Code on 14 May 1997 meant that married women acquired the right to put their maiden name in front of their husband’s surname. The applicant preferred not to make use of that option because, in her view, the amendment in question did not satisfy her request, which was to use her maiden name on its own. Following the enactment of the new Civil Code on 22 November 2001, Article 187 was worded identically to the former Article 153 (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below).

Between 1990 and 1997 she repeatedly underwent surgery in a clinic in the United States of America, following which her cranial disorders were mostly cured. However, owing to the extensive surgery, the applicant developed a mental illness. Since then she has needed regular supervision in the United States clinic. In 2007 the applicant’s father applied to the Simferopol District Court of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (“the District Court”), seeking to have her deprived of legal capacity on the ground that she suffered from serious mental illness. Following a request by the District Court, on 5 June 2007 a forensic psychiatric expert issued an opinion stating that the applicant suffered from a chronic mental illness, namely paranoid schizophrenia, which prevented her from comprehending and control	[3]	2	2	0
2387	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Irkutsk. In 2003 the applicant was charged with fraud relating to the alleged misappropriation of money in the private company she had worked for. Her case was brought before the Kuybyshevskiy District Court of Irkutsk. In the course of the trial, the applicant dismissed several legal-aid lawyers and, eventually, the trial court appointed lawyer V. as defence counsel. During the court proceedings before the District Court an issue arose as to the applicant’s mental state and ability to stand trial. Thus, on 14 October 2003 after hearing the parties (including the applicant and lawyer V.), the District Court decided that the applicant should undergo an out-patient psychiatric examination in the regional psychiatric hospital. However, the applicant refused to comply with this court order. A trial hearing was accordingly scheduled for 27 November 2003, inter alia, to settle the issue of the examination.

The family lived in Virginia. In 2003, following a visit to relatives in Hungary, J.B. did not return to the USA and instituted divorce proceedings. The applicant initiated proceedings before the Hungarian courts in order to have the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (“the Hague Convention”) applied and the child taken back to the USA. By a decision of 14 September 2004, the Hungarian Supreme Court found that the retention of the child in Hungary by her mother without the father’s consent was illegal but refused to grant a return order under the Hague Convention. The applicant’s visiting rights were regulated through a number of interim measures pending the divorce proceedings. On 19 March 2005, following the pronouncement of the divorce 	[4]	2	2	0

On 25 August 1997 the applicant’s neighbour brought an action against the applicant before the Pest Central District Court, requesting the court to establish that she had acquired ownership through adverse possession of the applicant’s plot of land. On 29 April 1998 the court held the first hearing. At the hearing of 5 October 1998 the applicant submitted a counter-claim for usage charges against the plaintiff. The court suspended the proceedings pending the land registry proceedings seeking the rectification of the land registry title plan. The next hearing took place on 28 October 2002. At the following hearing of 17 February 2003 the court again suspended the proceedings pending the termination of the same land registry proceedings before the district notary, which finally took place on 3 June 2003.

From January 1981 onwards she had a contract of indefinite duration and worked as a photographer at the embassy. Following an accident in 1983, the competent authority issued a decision stating that she qualified for protection under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act (Invaliden­einstellungs­gesetz). The embassy dismissed her in September 1987, following a further accident in March of that year which was classified as work-related. While the applicant was employed by the US embassy in Vienna, she registered herself as an employee under the social security system pursuant to section 35(4)(a) of the General Social Security Act (Allgemeines Sozialversicherungsgesetz).

At the end of 1994 such trading was prohibited by the Securities Market Act however the applicant continued with the activity until 1996. In 1996 the applicant instituted enforcement proceedings against the company Kompas Maribor D.O.O. before the Maribor District Court seeking the payment of lost investments from Kompas Maribor for not informing her of the legislative amendments and continuing with the trading of commercial papers. She further complained before the domestic courts that as the company Kompas Consulting d.d. was bankrupt, she could only receive back a small proportion of her investments in bankruptcy proceedings. On 14 October 1996 the Maribor District Court issued a writ of execution. On 12 November 1996 following an objection the case was refe	[3]	3	2	0

The authorisation was granted at the request of the Romanian Intelligence Service (“the RIS”) under the National Security Act (Law no. 51/1991). On 25 August 2000 the prosecutor’s office issued a new similar authorisation, under the National Security Act, granting interception of another of the applicant’s telephone lines, also until 4 October 2000.

On 7 September 2000 the applicant was convicted by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court of the manslaughter of her four-month-old son, Patrick. She was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. Evidence was given at her trial by expert medical witnesses who described how the injuries suffered by her son were consistent with shaking or an impact. The conviction was based on the accepted hypothesis concerning “shaken baby syndrome”, also known as “non-accidental head injury” (NAHI), to the effect that the finding of a triad of intracranial injuries consisting of encephalopathy, subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages were either diagnostic of, or at least very strongly suggestive of, the use of unlawful force. All three were present in the case of the death of the applicant’s son. The applicant did not, immediately after her trial, appeal against her conviction. Following a review by the	[]	2	2	1

On 10 February 2010 the applicant received an e-mail from a person who called himself “Neo”, revealing that there were serious security flaws in a database maintained by the State Revenue Service (Valsts ieņēmumu dienests – “the VID”). Allegedly, these flaws made it possible to access the data stored in the Electronic Declaration System (Elektroniskā deklarēšanas sistēma – “the EDS”) without breaching any security protocols. In support of his allegations, “Neo” attached some examples of the data which he had downloaded in this manner (for example, salaries of LTV employees), the veracity of which the applicant could confirm.

According to that plan, two plots of land owned by the applicant fell within a zone in which the construction of buildings was not authorised. By submissions of 28 March 2000 the applicant, who was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, lodged an objection with the Municipality of Triesenberg. She contested the lawfulness of the land development plan, which she considered in breach of her right to equality and to protection of her property and requested that the plots of land in question be designated as building land. On 15 November 2000 the Municipality of Triesenberg dismissed the applicant’s objection. It found, in particular, that the applicant’s plots of land were not fully developed for lack of complete water installations. Her real property had not been cla	[]	3	2	1

She, however, kept her maiden name in front of her husband’s surname as provided for by the same provision. On 9 May 2007 the applicant brought proceedings before the Şişli Court of First Instance for permission to use only her maiden name, “Tuncer”. On 18 July 2007 the Şişli Court of First Instance dismissed the applicant’s request on the ground that, under Article 187 of the Turkish Civil Code, married women had to bear their husband’s name throughout their marriage and were not entitled to use their maiden name alone. The applicant appealed. On 22 November 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment.	[4, 8]	2	2	0

On 3 March 2008 the Cantemir District Court found the applicant guilty of unlawfully appropriating money (1,400 Moldovan lei (MDL)) collected by her community to fund certain celebrations. She was ordered to pay a fine of 600 conventional units (each such unit being equal to MDL 20; overall MDL 12,000 (approximately 775 euros (EUR) at the time) and was barred from holding public office for two years and a half. On 7 July 2008 the Cahul Court of Appeal partly upheld that judgment, relying on a different paragraph of the Criminal Code, but preserving the sentence. That judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court of Justice in a final judgment of 26 November 2008.

According to the police records, the security forces had been informed of the demonstration and had taken the necessary measures beforehand. The records noted that following the statement and the speeches made by the Members of Parliament, the crowd started marching and shouting slogans praising the imprisoned leader of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an illegal organisation). After some members of the group attacked police officers with stones, the security forces intervened, as a result of which the crowd dispersed, damaging a number of shop fronts on their way. The records stated that a few hours later the demonstrators regrouped once again, this time setting trash containers on fire and blocking traffic.	[1]	1	2	0
2402	 The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Budapest. On 18 December 1999 the applicant brought a labour action against her former employer for unlawful dismissal. After holding several hearings and obtaining expert evidence, the Budapest Labour Court dismissed the action on 28 February 2005. The applicant appealed. On 26 August 2005 the Budapest Regional Court, acting as a second-instance court, reversed the first-instance decision and ordered the defendant to pay the applicant 180,582 Hungarian forints (HUF)[1] in unpaid employment benefits plus interests and HUF 200,000[2] in non-pecuniary damages. The applicant filed a petition for review. On 25 October 2006 the Supreme Court decided that the petition had not disclosed a breach of the relevant law.

On 31 May 1976 the State transferred the right to the use of the land to the Třebíč municipality. In 1990 the majority of the land was transferred to the Třebíč cadastral area and the plots were renumbered. The land now comprises the following plots: no. 7283 and parts of nos. 7281, 7378, 2174/1, 2174/2 and 2174/3 in the cadastral area of Třebíč and nos. 1136/1, 1136/19 and a part of no. 1138/1 in the cadastral area of Kožichovice.

By a decision of the Minister of Justice of 29 December 2001, the applicant was included on the list of persons qualified to act as liquidators of insolvent companies (see paragraphs 24-27 below). On 23 December 2003 the Sliven Regional Court decided to appoint the applicant liquidator of the State-owned company T., in respect of which that court had decided to open winding-up proceedings. The company’s management disapproved of the applicant’s performance and several times tried unsuccessfully to have her replaced by the insolvency court. On 31 March 2004 the company’s management complained to the Minister of Justice about the applicant’s performance as liquidator. Accordingly, in a letter dated 8 April 2004 the Deputy Minister of Justice informed the applicant that proceedings under section 655(3) of the Commerce Act 1991 (see parag	[]	2	2	0
2418	 The applicant was born in 1920 and resides in Vilnius. In 2000, the local authorities restored the applicant’s rights to part of a plot of land located near house no. 43 in Svajonių street in the Valakupiai neighbourhood in Vilnius. The plot had belonged to her late mother, but had been nationalised in the 1940s. The applicant brought an action against the Vilnius local authority, claiming restitution of her property rights to the remaining 0.33 hectares of the plot in natura. On 21 December 2001 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court dismissed her action as unsubstantiated. It noted that in the Government ruling no. 239 (see Relevant domestic law and practice part below) the area where the plot was located was designated as a forest of national importance. Given that such forests were to be bought out by the State, in accordance with Article 13 of the Law on the Restoration of the Rights of Ownership of Citizens to Existing Real Property enacted in 19	[3, 9]	3	2	0
2419	 The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Akademija, Kaunas Region. In 1994 a local authority assigned a plot of land of 0.5 hectares to the applicant. On 6 August 1996 the Kaunas Region Administration confirmed the sale of the land to the applicant. By an agreement of 24 September 1996 she acquired the plot of land from the State for 61 “single-use investment vouchers” (investiciniai čekiai) and registered it with the Land Registry in her name. The applicant then grew vegetables on the plot and sold them at the market. Following a civil claim brought in December 2001 by third parties seeking restoration of ownership rights to that plot, on 2 October 2003 the Kaunas Regional Court, acting as a court of appeal, quashed the authorities’ decision of 6 August 1996 as unlawful, and cancelled the sale of the disputed plot of land, which then had to be returned to the State. It was concluded that the authorities did not have the right to sell that plo	[9]	3	2	0
2420	 The applicant was born in 1987 and lives in Ludvika. In September 2002, when she was 14 years old, she discovered that her stepfather had hidden a video-camera in the laundry basket in the bathroom, which was in recording mode and directed towards the spot where she had undressed before taking a shower. Immediately after the incident, the film was burned without anyone seeing it. In September 2004, two years later, the applicant’s mother reported the incident to the police. An officially appointed counsel (målsägandebiträde) was assigned to the applicant on 5 October 2004. On 21 October 2005 the public prosecutor indicted the applicant’s stepfather for sexual molestation (sexuellt ofredande) under Chapter 6, Article 7 § 3, of the Penal Code. He was also charged on two counts of sexual molestation of the applicant’s cousin, committed during the spring and summer of 2003 when the cousin was 16 years old, for having caressed her thigh and for having expr	[4]	1	2	1

On 16 October 2006 the applicant submitted a request to the Zagreb office of the Croatian Health Insurance Fund (Hrvatski zavod za zdravstveno osiguranje Područni ured u Zagrebu) seeking to establish her right to paid maternity leave. On 20 October 2006 the Zagreb office of the Croatian Health Insurance Fund dismissed the applicant’s request on the grounds that under the legislation on maternity leave for self-employed entrepreneurs and unemployed mothers (“the Maternity Leave Act”), biological mothers were entitled to paid maternity leave only until the child’s first birthday, and adoptive mothers had to be treated equally.

2422	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Koksovyy, the Rostov Region. The applicant worked for 15 years in the Extreme North of Russia. She instituted court proceedings against local pension authorities claiming recalculation of her pension. On 18 July 2003 the Kolskiy District Court of the Murmansk Region granted her claim. The court ordered the Pension Fund of the Kolskiy District of the Murmansk Region to recalculate her pension paid after 1 January 2002 by counting one year of her service in the Extreme North as one and a half years of working record and to pay her respective pension arrears for the period between 1 January 2002 and 18 July 2003. On 20 August 2003 the judgment was upheld on appeal by the Murmansk Regional Court and entered into force. It appears that the parties were not present at the appeal hearing.

2424	 The applicant was born in 1974 and now resides in Australia. She is a Latvian national, who, in 2007, also acquired Australian nationality. After meeting T. and beginning a relationship with him at the beginning of 2004, she moved into his flat at the end of that year, although she was still married to another man, R.L., whom she divorced on 24 November 2005. On 9 February 2005 the applicant gave birth to a daughter, E. The child’s birth certificate does not give the father’s name, and no paternity test was carried out. The applicant, who was still living with T., subsequently received single-parent benefits. In spite of the deterioration in their relationship, the applicant continued to live with T. as a tenant. On 17 July 2008 the applicant left Australia for Latvia with her daughter, then aged three years and five months. On 19 August 2008 T. submitted an application to the Family Court in Australia to establish his parental rights in resp	[4]	2	2	0
2425	 The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Karlovac. The applicant and her husband were holders of a specially protected tenancy on a flat in Karlovac. In 1991 a bomb was thrown into the flat and the family moved out of the flat for security reasons. By a decision of the Karlovac Housing Committee of 29 November 1991 they were given another flat in Karlovac for temporary occupation. The applicant’s husband moved out of the flat in 1992 and they subsequently divorced. The applicant and two children born of the marriage continued to occupy the flat. The above-said decision was annulled by the same Commission on 11 November 2000. In 2000 the Karlovac Municipality, as the owner of the flat, brought a civil action in the Karlovac Municipal Court against the applicant, seeking her eviction. The claim was granted on 1 February 2008 on the ground that the flat at issue had been given for temporary occupation to the applicant’s husband who had left the flat and that that 	[4]	2	2	0
2426	 The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Münster, Germany. The applicant’s father owned a plot of land with two houses on it in the centre of the city of Kaunas, Lithuania. The plot was nationalised following the Soviet occupation in the 1940s. Ownership of the houses was attributed to the former wife of the applicant’s father in 1948 and she continued living there. At some time between 1964 and 1968 the title to the buildings was transferred to third persons. After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, the applicant applied for the property to be returned to him in natura, pursuant to the 1991 legislation on restitution of property rights. He submitted a complete request to the authorities in 1997 and again in 1999. In his first court action, the applicant sought to oblige the authorities to restore his property rights to the two buildings. On 16 October 2000 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court dismissed his claim on the ground t	[3, 9]	3	2	0
2427	 The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Istanbul. On 30 October 1992 the applicant, who is a university professor, got married and took her husband’s surname pursuant to Article 153 of the Turkish Civil Code. As she was known by her maiden name in her academic and professional life, she continued using it. However, she could not use it in official documents. Following the amendment made to Article 153 of the Civil Code on 14 May 1997 that entitled married women the right to put their maiden name in front of their husband’s surname, the applicant started to avail herself of this possibility in official documents. Following the adoption of new Civil Code on 22 November 2001, Article 187 was worded identically to the former Article 153. On 5 December 2007 the applicant brought proceedings before the Beyoğlu Court of First Instance for permission to use only her maiden name, “Tanbay”.

On an unspecified date in 2005 the applicant, with the assistance of a lawyer, brought proceedings against a third party seeking the annulment of a will and the acknowledgement of her inheritance rights. She estimated the value of the deceased’s estate to be 31,800 lei (RON) (approximately 9,244 euros (EUR)). By a judgment of 21 December 2005 the Iaşi District Court, acting as a court of first-instance, allowed the applicant’s action on the merits and acknowledged her inheritance rights. The operative part of the judgment expressly stated that it was subject to appeal within fifteen days of notification. The third party appealed. By a judgment of 4 April 2007 the Iaşi County Court, sitting as a bench of two judges, allowed the third party’s appeal on the merits, quashed the judgment of 21 December 2005 and dismissed the applicant’s action. The operative part of the judgment expressly stated that	[3]	3	2	0

She filed an indictment proposing A.B.’s conviction in both sets of proceedings. The first indictment, filed by the applicant on 17 January 2000, sought the conviction of A.B. for the offences of making false declarations and destruction. On 20 September 2001 the Ploiești District Court found A.B. guilty as charged and sentenced her to six months’ imprisonment in respect of each offence. The judgment was upheld by the Prahova County Court, which dismissed an appeal lodged by A.B. on 7 January 2002.

He died on 14 June 2000. The applicant and their two children were declared his successors. On 21 May 2002 the Daruvar Municipal Court, on the basis of an accounting expert report commissioned during the proceedings, found that the applicant’s husband had not received his full salary for the period May 1998 to January 1999. It therefore ordered company V.S. to pay the applicant’s husband’s family the sum of 24,540.81 Croatian kunas (HRK) on account of his salary arrears, together with any statutory default interest accruing from that date.

She claimed that she had been unlawfully dismissed from public service. On 14 November 2007 the Labour Court found against her. Relying on various pieces of evidence, the court was satisfied that the reasons for the applicant’s dismissal were real and relevant. On 10 April 2008 the Hajdú-Bihar County Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. On 11 November 2009 the Supreme Court rejected her petition for review (service: 17 December 2009). The applicant’s criminal accusations made in the above context against third persons were to no avail.	[3]	2	2	0
2450	 The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Pomarkku. On 9 June 2005 the applicant’s husband was injured in a car accident and he received insurance benefits from an insurance company. However, on 2 and 5 March 2006 the insurance company refused his applications for compensation for rehabilitation. On 30 March and 4 April 2006 the husband appealed against these decisions to the Insurance Court (vakuutusoikeus, försäkringsdomstolen). The husband died on 3 August 2006 but the applicant and the estate decided to continue the appeals. On 3 May 2010 the Insurance Court rejected the appeals. No appeal lies against these decisions. The judgment of the Insurance Court was sent to the applicant on 1 June 2010. On 26 February 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Parliamentary Ombudsman (eduskunnan oikeusasiamies, riksdagens justitieombudsman) complaining, inter alia, about the excessive length of the proceedings in the Insurance Court.

On 16 June 1997 the applicant gave birth in the Cēsis District Central Hospital (a municipal enterprise, hereinafter “the Cēsis hospital”). Caesarean section was used, with the applicant’s consent, because uterine rupture had occurred during labour. In the course of that surgery the surgeon performed tubal ligation (surgical contraception) without the applicant’s consent. On 4 February 2005, after her attempt to achieve an out-of-court settlement with the hospital had failed, the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the hospital, seeking to recover damages for the unauthorised tubal ligation. In December of 2006 her claim was upheld and she was awarded compensation in the amount of 10,000 Latvian lati for the unlawful sterilisation. On 19 February 2004 the director of the Cēsis hospital wrote to the Inspectorate of Quality Control for Medical Care and Fitness for Wo	[4]	2	2	0

In April 2006 she fell heavily, breaking her hip in several places. She then suffered two further falls, both of which resulted in further hospitalisation. The applicant has a small and neurogenic bladder. As a result, she usually has to urinate some two to three times a night. On account of her mobility problems she is unable safely to access a toilet or commode unaided. In March 2007, after the applicant’s third fall, she applied to the Independent Living Fund (“ILF”) for full day and night support. While the application was pending she was provided with a care package by the local authority (the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea) which included seventy hours per week of night-time care.

In 1991 and 1992 she suffered miscarriages and a stillbirth, which caused her a long lasting psychological trauma. In summer 1999 she became pregnant with twins after an extramarital affair. The natural father insisted on an abortion, as did the husband of the applicant. Both men threatened to leave her. In November 1999 the husband of the applicant moved out and threatened to stop paying maintenance for his two sons and to the applicant. He put further pressure on her by threatening to break off all contact with his sons if she sued for maintenance. Instead, he offered to move back in with the applicant if she gave away the “illegitimate” children. The applicant’s sister and her mother refused to support her. The applicant felt extremely guilty for having destroyed the family situation for her two sons, yet she was determined not to have 	[]	2	2	1

According to the applicant at 9.45 p.m. on 15 November 1991 five men, wearing camouflage uniforms and balaclavas, had come to their house in Sisak and taken her husband, Vaso Jelić, who was of Serbian ethnic origin. All five men were carrying firearms. She had reported the entire incident to the police on the same evening. On 19 November 1991 the Sisak Police interviewed a certain B.S., who told them that on 15 November 1991 four men dressed in camouflage uniforms and wearing balaclavas had come to his flat and taken him to a lorry, where they had tied his hands and blindfolded him. Soon afterwards they had placed another person in the van, and they were transported to an unknown building. There the men had questioned him, then driven him somewhere else and released him.

On 2 September 2009 the applicant stopped her car on the road in front of a school to let her children get out of the car. At that time, during a regular control, police officer S. found that the applicant had failed to use the seat-belt. The next day, the applicant allegedly approached S. and started insulting her. S. asked the applicant to follow her to the police station but the applicant refused to do so. Then S. requested the applicant to present her identity card which the applicant also refused to do. On the same day, S. issued a penalty notice against the applicant for not using the seat-belt, indecent behaviour, failure to comply with a public official’s lawful order and failure to submit identity papers. The fine amounted to 991.12 euros (EUR). On 22 October 2009 the applicant filed a request for judicial rev	[3]	2	2	0

2466	 The applicant is a French national who was born in 1990 and lives in France. In the applicant’s submission, she is a devout Muslim and she wears the burqa and niqab in accordance with her religious faith, culture and personal convictions. According to her explanation, the burqa is a full-body covering including a mesh over the face, and the niqab is a full-face veil leaving an opening only for the eyes. The applicant emphasised that neither her husband nor any other member of her family put pressure on her to dress in this manner. The applicant added that she wore the niqab in public and in private, but not systematically: she might not wear it, for example, when she visited the doctor, when meeting friends in a public place, or when she wanted to socialise in public. She was thus content not to wear the niqab in public places at all times but wished to be able to wear it when she chose to do so, depending in particular on her spiritual feelings.

On 4 January 1994 the Leninskyy District Court of Zaporizhzhya ordered the applicant’s former husband, S., to pay her child maintenance in respect of their daughter, who was living with the applicant. According to a bailiff’s report of 24 January 2006, the outstanding arrears to the applicant at that date were 7,546 Ukrainian hryvnias ((UAH), at the time equivalent to about 1,200 euros (EUR)), of which UAH 2,052 (about EUR 330) was owed for 2005. The bailiff’s calculations were based on the average salary indicators in the district where S. lived, since he had been unemployed at the time. On 1 April 2006 the same bailiff issued a fresh report, assessing the total amount of the arrears at 31 March 2006 at UAH 667.50. The sum owed for 2005 was assessed at UAH 480.

On 1 June 1994 the applicant’s father, Mr Vladimir Dmitrievich Yakovlev, deposited an unspecified amount of money with the Savings Bank of the Russian Federation (“the Savings Bank”) in her name. The deposit was to be kept for at least ten years and was redeemable after the applicant had reached the age of sixteen. The interest rate was fixed at 190 per cent per annum. Later, the Savings Bank reduced the interest rate. Considering the Savings Bank’s unilateral decision unlawful, Mr Yakovlev brought a civil claim against it. On 25 July 2001 the Frunzenskiy District Court of Saratov found that the terms of the deposit did not provide for unilateral changes in the interest rate and held that the Savings Bank should calculate interest at the rate of 190 per cent starting from 1 June 1994 and until the maturity of the deposit.

The applicant brought the court action against the authorities, claiming the full monetary value of the special‑purpose settlement orders for purchasing of a car. On 19 August 2002 the Yakutsk Town Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic allowed the applicant’s action. The court found that the State commodity bonds, including the special-purpose settlement orders, were to be recognised as the State internal debt, and should be settled at the expense of the federal budget. With reference to the State Commodity Bonds Act of 1995 as amended on 2 June 2000 the court noted that the compensation to the bearers of special-purpose settlement orders that gave the right to purchase passenger cars in 1993-1995 was to b	[3, 9]	3	2	0

Since that time, she has lived as a woman. On 29 September 2009 she underwent gender reassignment surgery. On 7 June 2006 the applicant changed her first names and renewed her passport and driver’s licence but she could not have her identity number changed. The identity number still indicates that she is male, as does her passport. On 12 June 2007 the applicant requested the local registry office (maistraatti, magistraten) to confirm her status as female and to change her male identity number to a female one as it no longer corresponded to the reality.

Her parents, especially her mother, had been aggressive towards her both verbally and physically, had refused to allow her to go anywhere unsupervised and had taken her to a psychologist because she had not achieved the highest possible marks when she was in second grade. In addition, her parents’ abuse had continued after they discovered that she had been attending weekly yoga classes organised by the Movement for Spiritual Integration into the Absolute (Mişcarea pentru Integrare Spirituală în Absolut – “MISA”).

On 10 July 1979 her legal capacity was fully restored by a ruling of the Zagreb Municipal Court. On 12 November 2009 the Pešćenica Social Welfare Centre (hereinafter “the Centre”) asked the Zagreb Municipal Court to institute proceedings with a view to partially depriving the applicant of her legal capacity in order to prevent her from disposing of her assets. They relied on a previous ruling of 1968 by the same court by which the applicant had been deprived of her legal capacity (see the preceding paragraph).

She explained that she was becoming increasingly frail as time passed and was unwilling to continue suffering the decline of her physical and mental faculties. She decided that she wished to end her life by taking a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital. She contacted an assisted-suicide association – EXIT – for support, which replied that it would be difficult to find a medical practitioner who would be prepared to provide her with a medical prescription for the lethal drug. On 20 October 2008 a psychiatrist, Dr T., submitted an expert opinion in which he observed that there was no doubt that the applicant was able to form her own judgment. From a psychiatric medical point of view, Dr T. did not have any objection to the applicant being prescribed a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital. However, he refrained from issuing the prescripti	[3]	3	2	1

On 14 March 2003 the acting prosecutor of the Pacific Fleet issued a warrant to search the applicant’s flat. The parties did not submit a copy of the warrant. It is apparent from the search record of 14 March 2003 that the purpose of the search was “to find and seize objects and documents, including draft calculations in respect of the salary due to [K.] and other naval officers of the ship Argun, and other data storage media exposing [K.’s] involvement in criminal activity”.

The staff responsible for body searches found on the applicant “close to the left side of her abdomen”, a piece of paper that had been folded several times and wrapped in tape. It was an unsigned letter dated 24 April 2001, written by a member of the PKK and addressed to another member. The applicant was taken into police custody on the same day and questioned in Turkish by the gendarmes the following day. During the interview she stated that she had picked up the object in question in Van at the bus stop where she was waiting for the bus to Muş.

On 5 September 1994 the Leskovac Municipal Court (“the Municipal Court”) ordered the Leskovac branch of the “JIK” Bank (“the debtor”), a predominantly socially-owned bank, to reinstate the applicant and to pay her outstanding salary and all work-related benefits for the period following her unlawful dismissal. That judgment became final on 1 September 1995. On an unspecified date, the applicant filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment. On 17 October 1995 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution (rešenje o izvršenju). On 19 December 1995 the applicant was reinstated. However, as the debtor refused to pay the outstanding judgment debt, the applicant, on an unspecified date, filed a new request for the enforcement. On 18 November 1997, on the basis of a financial expert’s analysis, the Municipal Court ordered the enforcement by debtor account transfer in the total amount of	[3, 9]	2	2	0

By a decision of 18 June 2002 the Vilnius Region Administration restored the applicant’s property rights to 0.23 hectares of land in the context of restitution of property rights which had been violated by the unlawful nationalisation during the Soviet regime. Subsequently, the plot of land was registered in the land registry in her name. On 15 July 2002 the applicant sold the plot of land for 76,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL; approximately 22,000 euros (EUR)) to two private buyers, E.T. and D.Z., who became the owners of the plot. In August 2003 the Vilnius Region Administration found that a mistake had been made in granting the plot of land to the applicant and notified her and, later, the public prosecutor. In June 2004 the public prosecutor initiated civil proceedings to have the decision of 18 June 2002 and sale contract annulled on the ground that in 1993 part of the same plot of land had alr	[9]	3	2	0

According to the arrest record, she was arrested at 3.30 a.m. on 6 April 2007. Following the arrest, the applicant was taken to a police station where she was questioned by an investigator in the presence of a lawyer. Prior to the questioning, she wrote a statement admitting to S.’s abduction. According to her, police officers threatened to beat her if she refused to make a written statement. She did not explain whether she had been denied access to a lawyer prior to writing the statement. According to the applicant, on the morning of 6 April 2007 she was taken to the town prosecutor’s office. She was taken to an office where policemen started beating her and urging her to confess to S.	[1, 3]	2	2	0
2483	 The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Liepāja. On 1 November 2007, when the applicant was in the courtyard of her apartment building, two officers from the municipal police force (J.M. and J.L.) pulled up in a car. After having a conversation with the applicant they twisted her arms behind her back and forced her to approach their car. She was eventually let go, but later she started feeling ill and had to call an ambulance. The applicant submits that she still felt ill effects on her health more than a year after the events of 1 November 2007. On 2 November 2007 the applicant wrote to the Liepāja City Public Prosecutor’s Office and requested that criminal proceedings be instituted against the officers responsible. The applicant stated that she had told the officers that they could go and talk in her apartment, after which one of them had grabbed her right upper arm and twisted her arm behind her back, she avoided the grip owing to pain, while the police off	[]	2	2	0
2484	 The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Budapest. At the material time, the applicant lived in the United States. On 14 January 2001 she arrived in Hungary on a visit. She had a laptop with her which she had bought on 9 January 2001 in the United States for 1,624 US dollars (approximately 1,500 euros (EUR) at that time). She did not declare it to the airport customs authority, since in her opinion it constituted a ‘travel item’, exempted from customs duty, within the meaning of section 110 of Act no. C of 1995 and section 185(3) of the implementing Decree of the Act. Although she specified to the authorities that she was living abroad and had no intention of importing the laptop into Hungary but intended to take it back to the United States on departure, the customs authority nevertheless seized the laptop and filed a criminal report, charging the applicant with smuggling. A bill of indictment was preferred by the Budapest X/XVII District Public Prose	[3, 9]	2	2	0
2485	 The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Vilnius. By an agreement of 18 July 2000 and an order of the Vilnius Region Administration of 21 June 2000 the applicant acquired from the State a plot of land measuring 0.2 ha for 59,776 Lithuanian litai (LTL; approximately 17,312 euros (EUR)) and registered it in the land registry in her name. According to the documents issued by the authorities, the plot was designated for residential use (namų valda). The applicant had previously, in 1999, acquired from a private person the remains of a burned-down house (registered in the real estate registry) which stood on that land, with the intention of renovating it. In December 2002 after establishing that the sale was not in accordance with the law, a public prosecutor applied to the courts to have the sale contract and related legal acts of the authorities annulled in order to protect the public interest.

At some point relations between the couple deteriorated. As was established by the Moldovan courts in subsequent proceedings, on 24 June 2008 Ms E.P. moved to the town of Cahul, in Moldova, where her parents lived. The boy, A.P., went with her. On 22 August 2008 Ms E.P. initiated divorce proceedings before the Rîșcani District Court of Chisinau. She also sought a residence order in her favour in respect of A.P. On 25 September 2008 the applicant filed a counterclaim seeking a residence order in his favour in respect of the child. On 13 September 2008, while the proceedings were still pending, Ms E.P. left Moldova with the child and settled in Moscow, Russia. On 1 October 2008 the court fixed a contact schedule, pursuant to which the applicant was to be allow	[4]	2	2	0
2487	 The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Iaşi. The applicant, who was admitted to the Bucharest Bar Association in December 2004, was involved, as a party, in several sets of civil and criminal proceedings. In February 2003 she was informed by E.E., a prosecutor attached to the Iaşi District Court, that she was suspected of incitement to false testimony. She was specifically suspected of having persuaded the witnesses in a different set of criminal proceedings to give false testimony. The development of those proceedings is described in paragraphs 37 to 57 below. At about 9 a.m. on 28 May 2003 the applicant went to the prosecutor’s office attached to the Iaşi District Court. According to her, she wanted to submit a complaint to the superior of the prosecutor investigating the case against her. According to the Government, the applicant went there at the prosecutor’s invitation in order to be informed of the content of the criminal file against her (p	[2]	2	2	0
2488	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in İzmir. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s daughter, Gülperi O., worked as a nurse at the Aegean University Hospital in İzmir. She was married to O.O., who worked in the pharmacy at the same hospital. According to the applicant, the couple had frequent rows and O.O. used violence against Gülperi O. on a number of occasions. At 5.30 p.m. on 18 July 2005 O.O. brought Gülperi O. to the accident and emergency department of the Aegean University Hospital and told the doctors and nurses at the hospital that she had taken an overdose of two medicines called “Prent” and “Muscoril”. A police officer at the hospital took a statement from O.O. at 6.45 p.m. In his statement O.O. was reported as having stated that he and Gülperi O. had had a row earlier in the day; she had attacked him and 	[0]	2	2	0
2489	 The applicant was born in 1937 and lived in Aistersheim. The applicant owned a landholding of some 150 hectares, which is an approved hunting ground (Eigenjagd). According to the Upper Austrian Hunting Act (Oberösterreichisches Jagdgesetz), every six years, the District Authority has to establish the boundaries of the Upper Austrian hunting grounds. In this respect, requests may be filed by landowners to have adjacent land allocated to their hunting grounds where, for the purpose of facilitating the exercise of hunting rights, boundaries need readjustment (Arrondierungsantrag). On 29 September 2004 the applicant filed such a request for readjustment in respect of the next six years’ hunting period, i.e. from April 2005 to March 2011. On 28 December 2004 the Grieskirchen District Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) partly granted the applicant’s request and assigned specified plots of third persons to the applicant’s hunting grounds, but dismissed her request concer	[]	3	2	1
2490	 The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Espoo. The applicant had a husband and two daughters in Russia. In 1988 one of the daughters moved to Finland and has lived there permanently since then. She is a Finnish citizen. The other daughter went missing in 2003 and is probably dead. The applicant raised her granddaughter, who was born in 1986, from the age of 3 or 4, when the child’s mother went missing. In November 2006 the applicant suffered a stroke in Russia. Apparently her right side was then paralysed. At the time, she lived with her husband, until he died in 2007. Thereafter the applicant apparently lived with her granddaughter and her family near Vyborg. On 7 December 2008 the applicant arrived in Finland with a tourist visa issued for a period of 30 days, without having lodged a prior application for a residence permit at a Finnish Representation. Since then she has been living with her daughter in Espoo. On 17 December 2008 the appli	[]	3	2	1
2491	 The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 21 May 2004 at 08.15 two household workers (“M.R.” and “I.B”) discovered the body of the applicant’s daughter (“S.J.”) at her home in Ventspils. She had a rope around her neck, the other end of which was thrown over the top of a door and tied to the door handle on the other side. At 08.20 M.R. and I.B. reported the incident to the Ventspils City and District Police Department of the State Police (“the Ventspils State Police”). Three police officers from the Ventspils State Police were dispatched to S.J.’s home. S.J.’s husband (“A.J.”), who worked as a policeman-driver for the Ventspils State Police, arrived separately. The Government have provided details of the investigation which followed. Their account has not been disputed by the applicant. From 09.40 to 10.35 officers G.A. and A.G. from the Ventspils State Police examined S.J.’s home. They prepared the proce	[0]	0	2	0

She was receiving a pension from the Social Security Board. She has a daughter, with whom she apparently had had no contact for several years. On 24 March 1981, at the request of the applicant’s daughter, the Zielona Góra Regional Court declared the applicant to be partially incapacitated. The court established that she had been suffering from psycho-organic dementia syndrome with elements of paranoia and that she had a tendency to abuse alcohol and medications. It reasoned that it was necessary to declare her to be partially incapacitated because she needed help in making the right decisions, particularly as regards her treatment and the amount of money she spent on alcohol.

2493	 The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Hässelby, Sweden. By a decision of 1 June 2004 the Tax Agency (Skatteverket), noting that the applicant ran two restaurants together with her husband, Mr Shibendra Dev (who also lodged an application before the Court; no. 7362/10), found that they should each declare half of the proceeds and the costs of that business. As the applicant, in her tax return, had not declared all her income and had, moreover, not declared it in the correct manner, the Agency revised upwards her income for 2002 (i.e. the taxation year 2003), finding her liable to pay tax on undeclared business income (inkomst av näringsverksamhet) amounting to 764,945 Swedish kronor (SEK; approximately 83,000 euros (EUR)). It also increased her liability to value-added tax (mervärdesskatt; “VAT”) for 2002 by SEK 379,365 (approximately EUR 41,000). Finally, as the information supplied by the applicant in her tax return was found to be incorrect and the revision had had	[]	2	2	1

In the late evening of 1 April 2006 the applicant’s husband and his friend (P.) were attacked in a street of Novoyavorivsk by a group of young men. The applicant’s husband sustained grievous head injuries, including fractures to his skull. His friend sustained bruises and abrasions to his face, a fractured nose, brain concussion and other less serious injuries. Following the incident the applicant’s husband was placed in hospital and remained there in a vegetative state. On 2 and 3 April 2006 the police interviewed K., Dz. and Sh. who stated that they had beaten up the two men. On 11 April 2006 the investigator of the Yavorivsk District Police Department of Lviv Region (“the District Police Department”) opened an investigation into disorderly conduct by a group under Article 296 § 2 of the Criminal Code.

On 14 August 2003 Oksana Belenko complained of feeling ill. She was trembling, felt pain in her limbs, was having delusions and was behaving strangely. That evening her parents called an ambulance. The doctor of the ambulance team, having decided that she was suffering from hysterical neurosis, gave her some sedatives and painkillers. Her condition became worse, so the next morning she was taken to the town hospital, accompanied by her parents. In the town hospital she was examined by the chief psychiatrist, Rz., and a neuropathologist, Pn.

On 19 May 2001 the applicant’s husband was involved in a car accident in the parish of Allaži. An ambulance transported him to Sigulda Hospital but he died on the way there as a result of his injuries. He was placed in the mortuary at Sigulda Hospital. The applicant’s mother-in-law, who worked at Sigulda Hospital and thereby learned about her son’s death immediately, stayed with his body at Sigulda Hospital until it was transported to the State Centre for Forensic Medical Examination (Valsts tiesu medicīnas expertīžu centrs – “the Forensic Centre”) in Riga. At 5 a.m. on 20 May 2001 the body was delivered to the Forensic Centre in order to establish the cause of death.

In 1995 the applicant’s grandmother N. privatised (bought on favourable terms from the public authorities) an apartment at 9 Mahtra Street in Tallinn. In 1996 she gave the apartment to the applicant, who was represented by her mother V. in the transaction. On 21 April 2003 Zh. signed a power of attorney, witnessed by a notary, whereby he authorised N. to sell his apartment at 33 Punane Street in Tallinn. On 20 May 2003 N., acting on behalf of Zh., sold the apartment to her daughter V. For Zh., N. bought an apartment in the countryside worth about a twentieth of the value of the apartment at Punane Street. It appears that on 7 August 2003 V. asked the social security service of the local municipality to approve the sale of the then thirteen-year-old applicant’s apartment at 9 Mahtra Street. She submitted that she had bought another apartment at 33 Punane Street by means of a loan. She wished to pay back 	[]	1	2	0

Since their separation in September 1994, the applicant and A.’s mother, Ms J., have been quarrelling over the custody of and contacts with A. The child was initially living with her mother. In 2004, A. was placed in a home. On 9 November 2006 Ms J. laid an information against the applicant with the police, accusing him of having raped their daughter since 1998. As A. had persistently declared not to be ready to make a statement before the police, the proceedings were initially discontinued. Following a visit of A. to her mother, the latter informed the police that A. was now ready to testify. A. was heard by the police twice in May 2007. On 5 November 2007 psychological expert K., having examined A., submitted a report on the credibility of A.’s submissions.

On the evening of 3 November 1983, the applicant, who was eight months pregnant and was returning home from work, was attacked by three men, A.M., T.D. and N.T. They pulled her into a car, drove to a remote location and raped her one after the other. Immediately after the incident, the applicant went to the Maribor Police. The police arrested the three men at around midnight. They remained in custody following an investigating judge’s order. They were released from custody on 24 November 1983. The applicant was taken to the Maribor Hospital to be medically examined. On 5 November 1983 the police lodged a criminal complaint against A.M., T.D. and N.T. accusing them of rape. Three days later, the Maribor District Public Prosecutor asked the investigating judge of the Maribor Basic Court to open an investigation.

J., a suspected organiser of the smuggling, fled to Russia. Investigating authorities asked R., an expert in geology, to give an expert opinion in respect of the content of precious metals in the waste. According to the expert opinion, dated 1 March 2001, the value of the metals was 19,620.90 kroons (EEK) (approximately corresponding to 1,254 euros (EUR)). This value was above the limit of a “significant amount” as defined in criminal law. P. who apparently had certain interests in the matter, approached R. and asked him to prepare another expert opinion, which would state that the value of the metals was lower. R. drew up another report,	[3, 9]	2	2	0

On an unspecified date in 1992 the applicant was raped by her eldest uncle J.D., then aged nineteen, with whom she and her family were living at the time in her grandparents’ house. Thereafter J.D. forced the applicant to engage in sexual intercourse on a regular basis, approximately twice a week. This continued until March 1994, when the applicant, together with her mother, sister and stepfather moved to a nearby village, after which she would only visit her grandparents on the weekends and during the holidays. According to the applicant, on these occasions J.D. touched her in an inappropriate manner, and also attempted to have sexual intercourse with her once again. On 24 November 2000 the applicant told her school’s counsellor that she had been sexually abused. The school counsellor informed the local social work centre of the allegation of sexual abuse of a minor, and they, in turn, informed the polic	[1]	1	2	0

Their daughter, who is an Italian and Austrian national, was born in December 2006. Under Italian law the applicant and D.P. had joint custody of her. The relationship between the applicant and D.P. deteriorated and the latter left the family home on 31 January 2008, taking their daughter with her. The applicant applied to the Venice Youth Court (tribunale per i minorenni di Venezia) for an award of sole custody of the child and asked the court to issue a travel ban prohibiting her from leaving Italy without his consent. On 8 February 2008 the Venice Youth Court issued a travel ban in respect of the applicant’s daughter.

2504	 The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Istanbul. In a decision of 22 May 2007, which became final on 20 July of that year, the Üsküdar Family Court (Istanbul) authorised the applicant, who was then single, to adopt a child, E., born on 5 November 2003 to Ms S.Ö. Consequently, under Article 314 §§ 2 and 3 of the Civil Code (no. 4721), “Gözüm” was registered as the surname of E. in the register of births and on the child’s identity documents. However, the registrar refused to indicate the applicant’s forename under the heading “mother”, where the name “S.” was retained, this being the forename of the child’s biological mother. On 23 November 2007 the applicant applied to Üsküdar District Court seeking the replacement of the forename “S.” by her own. In her view, the fact that her forename had not been given as that of the mother of her adopted son was both discriminatory and unconstitutional, likely to undermine their personal, family and social development, an	[4]	2	2	0

At about 11 p.m. on 31 March 2005 the applicant gave birth by Caesarean section to a boy (Tolga Genç), who – at 36 weeks’ gestation[1] –was premature and weighed 2.5 kg. Shortly after his birth, Tolga began showing signs of respiratory distress. As there was no suitable neonatal unit in the Gümüşhane public hospital, the doctors decided to transfer the baby to the Karadeniz Teknik Üniversitesi Farabi public hospital (“KTÜ Farabi”), located in Trabzon, 110 km away. On 1 April 2005 at around 1.15 a.m. the KTÜ Farabi public hospital refused to admit Tolga on the grounds that there were no places available in the neonatal intensive care unit. Around 2 a.m. Tolga was transferred to the Trabzon Medico-Surgical and Obstetrics Centre	[0]	2	2	0
2506	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Voyvodinovo. The applicant worked as a driver of tractors and other heavy machines for a number of years before 1985. This work led to her developing dysfunctions of the nervous system. In 1985 she was declared to have a “third degree disability” and started receiving a disability pension. Between 1985 and 2000 the applicant underwent seven medical re‑examinations by the local Territorial Expert Medical Commission (“the TEMC”), the body competent to assess the level of disability. The medical examinations serve as a basis for the allocation of disability pensions. She was diagnosed with vegetative polyneuropathy of the upper extremities, coxarthrosis, cervical spondylosis and radiculopathy. On all occasions she was assessed to have a “third degree disability” ─ she had lost between 50% and 70% of her ability to work, which entitled her to receive a disability pension.

The applicant was insured by the Retired Civil Servants’ Fund (emekli sandığı) and all her medical expenses were covered by the insurance. Following the operation, the applicant’s heart condition did not improve and she suffered physiologically as a result of a disturbing noise coming from the mechanical heart valve. In 2003, the applicant found out from the press that the type of mechanical valve used in her operation was banned by the Ministry of Health because of serious production defects. Being convinced that she was subjected to negligence, the applicant decided to bring compensation proceedings against the Ministry of Health, the Retired Civil Servant’s Fund, the Ege University Hospital and the doctors who operated on her.

In these letters the applicant alleged in particular that she had a “special relationship” with the mayor of Magadan, that she was destined to protect people in high office, and that she was being persecuted by employees of the mayor’s office. On 17 April 2008 the Chief Psychiatrist of the MRPC asked the Magadan Town Court to order an involuntary psychiatric examination of the applicant.

Since 1997 the applicant has claimed, so far unsuccessfully, title to part of a house, owned by Mr M. at the material time, and to the land on which it stands. Her claim is based on the following arguments: that the part of the house in question was constructed at her and her late husband’s expense; that her husband lawfully obtained title to the property, which she subsequently inherited; that it was not sold to Mr M. despite there having initially been an agreement with the applicant’s son to that effect; and that the sales contract on which Mr M.’s claim to the property was based was forged. The applicant’s property claim was considered on numerous occasions by the domestic courts. Eventually, following the reassignment of the case by the Supreme Court to lower courts with different territorial jurisdiction, the appl	[3]	3	2	0

In 2003-05 the applicant, together with the lawyer Ms V., represented Ms D. in civil proceedings before the Proletarskiy District Court of Tula. On 13 April 2005 Judge S. of the District Court sent a complaint to the President of the Tula Bar Association. She alleged that the absence of the applicant and Ms V. without good cause had led to delays in the proceedings. She asked the President to institute disciplinary proceedings against the lawyers and to inform them of the next hearing in Ms D.’s case. In particular, she stated as follows: “I draw your attention to the conduct of the lawyers Mr Zubarev and Ms V., which is not compatible with the Lawyers’ Code of Ethics. It has encroached on the rights of the person they were representing before the court ... and has led to unjustifiable delays in the examination of the merits of the case.

2512	 Word of Life is an international religious organisation based in Uppsala, Sweden. In the early 1990s, three non-profit organisations affiliated with Word of Life (Слово на живот) were registered by the Sofia City Court under the Persons and Family Act, and one of these organisations opened a Bible study centre in Sofia. However, on 1 April 1994 the Supreme Court reversed the Sofia City Court’s decision to register the three organisations, on the ground that they had not submitted the necessary applications to renew their registration within the three month time-limit which had been introduced on 18 February 1994 following amendment of the Persons and Family Act. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the three organisations affiliated with Word of Life were deleted from the registry of non-profit organisations.

The mayor sought the explicit consent to that effect of the head of “Cleanliness” EOOD, considering that that was a statutory condition under section 31 (2) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000. The head of “Cleanliness” EOOD refused to give consent on 28 May 2002. The mayor issued a decision on 4 June 2002 in which he refused to provide the applicant with access to the information she sought. The mayor referred to section 37 	[6]	2	2	0

On 19 September 1999 the applicant, then a 22-year-old student, left Sofia for Blagoevgrad in a vehicle with two young men, B.Z. and S.P., and another young woman whom she frequented at the time and whose acquaintance she had made through one of her close friends, H.I. During the journey the two men told her that they intended to “sell” her as a prostitute to people with whom they were in contact in Blagoevgrad, and then to “take her back” after receiving the money. The applicant refused, but was threatened by B.Z. On their arrival at Blagoevgrad the group met a number of people in various cafés in the town; those people were apparently involved in prostitution rings abroad and discussed with B.Z. and S.P. sending the applicant to Greece, Italy or Macedonia to work as a prostitute and her alleged experience in the trade.

Subsequently, the applicant brought an action for division of the land between the sisters. While the proceedings were ongoing, H.M. brought an action for annulment of the applicant’s adoption. She claimed that the main aim pursued by her adoptive mother when she had sought to adopt the applicant had been to ensure emotional and financial support for her in old age and help with everyday activities. H.M. averred that the only aim pursued by the applicant in agreeing to the adoption had been to obtain inheritance rights. 	[4, 9]	2	2	0

The applicant worked as a conductor on the same bus. Usually they worked for two weeks and then had two weeks off. In March 2001 the applicant’s husband’s employer asked him to work for the two weeks which were supposed to be rest weeks, because the bus station did not have enough buses.

The applicant and her husband worked on route no. 7, which connected the Grozny bus station with Altayskaya Street. It went along Lenin Street and Pobeda Prospekt, which were connected by a bridge over the river Sunzha in the centre of Grozny. T	[0]	2	2	0

2527	 The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Las Vegas, United States of America. Her mother owned a plot of agricultural land of 1,000 square metres which was expropriated in 1952. Subsequently the plot was included in the urban territory of the Bankya district of Sofia. The applicant is her mother’s sole heir. In 1992, following the adoption of the Agricultural Land Act, the applicant requested that her property rights to the plot be restored. In a decision of 7 September 1994 the Bankya land commission held that, since the plot had become part of the urban territory, the procedure could only continue after the presentation of a plan of the plot and a certificate, showing whether any part of the plot had been constructed upon (see paragraph 23 below). In a letter dated 19 June 2000, in response to an inquiry of the applicant as to the status of her request for restitution, the Bankya land commission stated once again that it needed a plan and a 	[3]	3	2	0

Her father, of whom she is the sole heir, owned agricultural land in the area surrounding the village which was incorporated into an agricultural cooperative at the beginning of the 1950s. In 1991, following the adoption of the Agricultural Land Act (“the ALA”, see paragraph 17 below), the applicant applied for the land’s restitution. By a decision dated 10 March 1999 the land commission dealing with the case refused to restore her rights to two plots of 900 and 2,000 square metres respectively, noting that sheep pens had been built on them by the agricultural cooperative. It held that the applicant was entitled to compensation in lieu of restitution. The above decision was served on the applicant in 2004, whereupon she applied for a judicial review.

The same day the police examined the site and ordered a forensic examination of the body. On 23 June 2003 the applicant received a medical certificate indicating that her husband had died of a head injury. On 30 June 2003 the Gagarinskiy District Prosecutors’ Office in Sevastopol concluded that Mr Mashchenko’s death had resulted from a head injury caused by an accidental fall and there were no grounds for instituting criminal proceedings. They referred, primarily, to the statements by D., who had submitted that his friend Mr Mashchenko had accidentally fallen on his back in D.’s presence, after both of them had consumed some alcohol in the garage. An ambulance had been called, but Mr Mashchenko died before it had arrived. The investigation also referred to the stat	[0]	3	2	0

On 7 April 2009 criminal proceedings were instituted under Article 178 (fraud) of the Criminal Code against the applicant. On 20 August 2009 the criminal proceedings under Article 178 of the Criminal Code were terminated owing to the impossibility of determining the applicant’s whereabouts. On 24 August 2009 the applicant was invited to the Sabail District Police Office as a witness in connection with the above-mentioned criminal proceedings. After her arrival at the police office she had a conversation with the investigator which lasted approximately one hour. The applicant was then taken by three police officers to a drug rehabilitation centre, where it was established that she was a drug user. The applicant was then returned to the police office and she was subjected to a body search in the presence of two attesting witnesses (hal şahidi) and three police officers	[2]	2	2	0

On an unspecified date the applicant instituted proceedings against her neighbour, M., seeking to have dismantled a construction that the latter had built in 1987 inside the entrance of their multi-flat house for the purpose of insulating the building. In its place the applicant sought to install a wooden ramp for her wheelchair in order to facilitate her access to her flat, situated on the ground floor. It appears that during the court proceedings the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, modified her claim and asked for the construction in question not to be dismantled but to be allocated to her so that she could install a wooden ramp in its place. On 26 July 2007 the Armavir Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s claim, finding that the applicant had failed to substantiate wit	[3]	2	2	0

In order to obtain a permanent contract she took part in a competition organised by the City Council in February 2001. She succeeded, being the only candidate. After a few months, the atmosphere at the workplace became tense. R.C.A. was on probation in her new post and was therefore monitored and kept under close scrutiny. According to R.C.A.’s statements, she was persecuted by her superiors and even sexually harassed by the mayor. Therefore, she asked for the protection of the applicant, to whom she allegedly gave 1,000 German marks (DEM).

The group fixed banners expressing protest against the transport, by train, of radioactive waste from La Hague, France, to the interim storage facility in Gorleben, scheduled from 7 to 9 November 2008. The members of the group refused to have themselves roped down by the police, who had dissolved their assembly. They were finally roped down by Federal Police’s mountain rescue team. The police then arrested only the applicant at 2.40 p.m. while the other three participants remained at liberty. They further seized the banners and the climbing equipment.

2543	 The applicant was born in 1986 and lives in Chișinău. The applicant lived with her four-year-old daughter, A., and with her mother, G. Following a call from C.I., on 22 September 2011 the police removed A. from her home and placed her in the care of the Municipal Children’s Hospital “V. Ignatenco”. A medical report drawn up on the same day found that the applicant had severe alcohol intoxication. C.I. later stated to the police that, as a salesman in a shop on a street near the applicant’s house, he would regularly see the applicant and her mother drinking alcohol and failing to take care of A., who often had an unkempt appearance and would wander around without adult surveillance, asking for food. He called the police on the evening of 22 September 2011 after A. had asked him to call for an ambulance because her mother and grandmother had been fighting.

On 17 February 2004 the Minister of Justice filed a motion with the Council of Justice seeking to have the applicant dismissed from her post under Section 30 (8) of the Law on the Status of a Judge. The motion stated that the applicant had been severely reprimanded on three occasions, namely in 1997, 2000 and 2001, for various gross violations of the rules of criminal procedure and another set of disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against her on the same grounds in December 2003. On 2 March 2004 the Council of Justice examined the motion and decided to form a three-member commission to examine the factual basis of the motion and to report back to the Council.

The applicant applied as a homeless person to Birmingham City Council for assistance in October 2006. By letter dated 7 November 2006 the Council determined that the applicant was homeless, eligible for assistance, in priority need and not intentionally homeless. The authority therefore accepted that it owed the applicant the “main housing duty” to provide accommodation to her and her family. On 8 November 2006 the authority made the applicant an offer of accommodation which she refused because she was unhappy with the location. The authority told the applicant that in it	[]	0	2	1

On 16 November 2010 the police questioned K.’s neighbours and relatives who stated that the applicant had frequently beaten her. A. and B. stated that shortly before her death, K. had told them that on 29 June 2010 she had been beaten by the applicant. On 16 November 2010 the police instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of having beaten his mother which resulted in her death. On the same date the applicant was arrested for seventy-two hours.

It appears that the driver called an ambulance and the police. According to her statements to the police, Ms Ye. and the child had stopped at first in the middle of the road giving her the impression that they would wait until the car passed, but then had unexpectedly started running further across the road making the collision inevitable. On the same day the police inspected the site and questioned some witnesses. They submitted that Ms. Ye. and her daughter had been crossing the road at some distance from the marked pedestrian crossing. On 21 November 2005 the applicant’s daughter died in hospital.

2560	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Saint Petersburg. On 25 November 2007 the applicant took part in a march. The applicant was then taken to a police station and was accused of disobeying the police order for the march to disband, as it was considered to be a non-authorised public gathering. The applicant was suspected of an offence under Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences (CAO), which punishes disobedience of a lawful order by a public official. The police also considered that the applicant had committed an administrative offence under Article 20.2 of the CAO, on account of her participation in a public gathering which had not been subject to prior notification to the authorities, as required by the 2004 Public Gatherings Act. On the same day, the administrative offence record was submitted to a justice of the peace of the 201 district. The applicant was then apprised of her procedural rights under Article 25.1 of the CAO. 	[3]	3	2	0
2561	 The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Paris. The applicant was recruited on a three-month fixed-term contract, from 1 October to 31 December 1999, extended for one year from 1 January to 31 December 2000, as a contracted employee of the hospital civil service, to carry out the duties of a social worker in the psychiatric unit of Nanterre Hospital and Social Care Centre (“the CASH”) a public health establishment administered by the City of Paris. On 11 December 2000 the Director of Human Resources informed the applicant that her contract would not be renewed with effect from 31 December 2000. The reason given for the decision – which had been taken following complaints by certain patients being treated at the CASH – was that the applicant refused to stop wearing her head covering.

The applicant entered Malta in an irregular manner by boat on 27 May 2012. Upon arrival, she was registered by the immigration police, given an identification number (12H-006), and presented with two documents in English, one containing a Return Decision and the other a Removal Order. The Return Decision stated that she was a prohibited immigrant by virtue of Article 5 of the Immigration Act (Chapter 217 of the Laws of Malta) because she was in Malta “without means of subsistence and liable to become a charge on public funds”. The Return Decision also informed the applicant that her stay was being terminated and that she had the possibility to apply for a period of voluntary departure. The Removal Order was based on the consideration that the applicant’s request for a period of voluntary departure had been rejected. It 	[2]	1	2	1
2563	 The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Šilėnai, in the Šiauliai Region. In June 2000 the Radviliškis Land Department of the Šiauliai County Administration recognised L.S.G.’s right to the restoration of title to 4.07 hectares of land in the Radviliškis area. The plot of land in question had belonged to two other individuals, P.M. and E.M., and had been nationalised by the Soviet regime. Later that month the applicant and L.S.G. signed a notarised agreement by which L.S.G. transferred (perleido) to the applicant the right to the restoration of title to 2.07 hectares of the above-mentioned plot of land. The agreement did not indicate whether the applicant had given any money to L.S.G. in exchange for this right. However, the applicant subsequently claimed (see paragraph 12 below) that she had paid 1,400 Lithuanian litai (LTL; approximately 405 euros (EUR)). On 16 October 2001 the Šiauliai County Administration estimated that the value of the plot of la	[9]	3	2	0

On 21 April 1998 G. concluded an agreement with J., according to which she gave a part of her plot of land, measuring 285 sq. m., to him. It appears that the plot of land actually used by J., as separated by the fence, was 38.75 sq. m. bigger than the 285 sq. m. plot given by G. The 38.75 sq. m. also belonged to G. In this connection, another agreement was reached between G. and J., according to which G. gave her consent for J. to become the owner of the whole plot of land used by him. However, it appears that J.’s ownership rights were officially registered only in respect of the plot of land measuring 285 sq. m. On 28 April 1998 the applicant bought the larger plot of land from J. and, since the fence was still in place, continued to use also the 38.75 sq. m. strip of la	[3, 9]	3	2	0

She gave birth to a son who has irreversible injuries caused by the birth. On 26 January 2005 the applicant brought a civil action before the Almada Administrative Court against the hospital, claiming damages for the injuries caused to her son. She claimed that contrary to her doctor’s instructions, the medical staff who treated her during labor had not performed a caesarean thus her son being born with several problems which caused him permanent motor-neurone injuries. She held that the hospital was responsible for medical negligence at birth. On 9 March 2005 the hospital contested the civil action. On 17 October 2005 a preliminary hearing was held.

2568	 On 19 December 2005 the Sverdlovskiy District Court of Belgorod convicted the applicant of a drug offence and sentenced her to three years’ imprisonment. The judgment became final on 8 February 2006. On 21 December 2006 the Presidium of the Belgorod Regional Court, by way of a supervisory review, quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. By the same decision the Presidium authorised the applicant’s release on an undertaking to appear. A copy of the Presidium’s decision was sent by regular mail and reached the facility where the applicant was serving her sentence only on 9 January 2007. Upon receipt of a certified copy, the applicant was released on 15 January 2007. On 5 June 2007 the Sverdlovskiy District Court acquitted the applicant of all charges, relying on the Court’s judgment in the Vanyan v. Russia case (no. 53203/99, 15 December 2005).

In May 2008 she was informed of additional suspicions against her concerning further acts of abuse of office, forgery of documents and misappropriation of property. In June 2008 the applicant submitted a request to the pre-trial judge to terminate the criminal investigation on the grounds that it had been excessively long. The judge refused the request, noting that the investigation had been completed earlier that month and the case was ready for trial. On 4 July 2008 the case was referred for judicial examination.

2571	 The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Yerevan. She is unemployed and receives state welfare benefit. On 10 October 1991 the Republic of Armenia Executive Committee of the Mashtots District Council of People’s Deputies decided to allocate a flat to the applicant in a building in Yerevan, which was to be constructed by Kanaz Aluminium Factory (hereafter - the Factory). It appears that the foundation of the future building was laid but, as the Soviet Union collapsed, the construction of the building was stopped. On an unspecified date the Factory went bankrupt and a liquidation commission (hereafter - the commission) was set up. It appears that on 8 May 2007 the applicant lodged a request with the commission seeking to be allocated a flat or to receive money equivalent to its value. On 10 May 2007 the head of the commission rejected the applicant’s request on the ground that the building, of which one flat was to be allocated to the 	[3]	3	2	0

She also owned two houses and a garage situated on the plot. It appears that the applicant shared her household with her four children. Before 1993 the applicant, without permission, built on her plot of land a pavilion (շվաքարան) measuring about 230 sq. m which she used as a venue for trade. The pavilion featured in the ownership certificate issued to the applicant on 30 November 1998 as a “half-ruined construction”. On 1 August 2002 the Government adopted Decree no. 1151-N, approving the expropriation zones of the real estate situated within the administrative boundaries of the Kentron District of Yerevan to be taken for State needs, having a total area of 345,000 sq. m.

At the same time, according to him, he was allocated a specific plot measuring 3.61 ha, which, he had farmed and paid land tax on since that time. It appears that the allocated land consisted of at least two different parcels, one of them measuring 0.6021 ha. In September 1998 V.G. merged with Kh., a neighbouring collective farming company, which was designated as its successor. Following the merger, Kh. did not register itself as the new owner of the land formerly allocated to V.G. Subsequently the two farms separated again.

The applicant’s wife, who apparently considered it an unsafe place to stop other cars, overtook the police vehicle and sounded the horn, though she claims to have done this by accident. While being overtaken, the police officers noticed that the car driven by the applicant’s wife had no left rear light and that its rear registration plate was not lit.

It would appear that in 1971 the housing authorities awarded a specially protected tenancy (stanarsko pravo) of the flat to a certain Ms N.R. and her family. On 5 November 1996 the Lease of Flats Act entered into force. It abolished the legal concept of the specially protected tenancy and provided that the holders of such tenancies in respect of, inter alia, privately owned flats were to become “protected lessees” (zaštićeni najmoprimci).

2702	 The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Kharkiv. At the beginning of November 2008 some equipment was stolen from the enterprise at which the applicant worked. The Kharkiv Ordzhonikidze District Police Department invited the applicant and one of her colleagues for questioning in respect of the theft. On 8 November 2008, at 11.15 a.m., the applicant came to the police station. At about 11.35 a.m. on 8 November 2008 a senior detective officer, T., accompanied the applicant to the fourth floor of the police station. He asked her to wait in the corridor and entered office no. 56. Five minutes later the applicant heard a woman’s scream emanating from that office. T. opened the door and directed an officer passing by to take the applicant to his office. She was made to wait there for about twenty minutes. Then T. took her to office no. 56. He pushed her inside, twisted her arms behind her back and handcuffed her, even though she had offered no resi	[1]	2	2	0
2703	 The applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Zagreb. On 24 May 1961 the applicant’s husband was granted a specially protected tenancy in respect of a flat in Zagreb by the Yugoslav People’s Army (the “YPA”). The applicant, as his spouse, was also a holder of a specially protected tenancy of that flat. On 3 June 1991 Parliament enacted the Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo – hereinafter “the Sale to Occupier Act”), which regulated the sale of socially-owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy (see paragraph 19 below). However, State-owned flats were excluded. On 3 October 1991 the Government adopted a decree (Uredba o preuzimanju sredstava JNA i SSNO na teritoriju Republike Hrvatske u vlasništvo Republike Hrvatske) whereby it took all the YPA’s property in Croatia into State ownership. In 1995 the Act Amending the Sale to Occupier Act (Zakon o izmjenama i dopuna	[9]	3	2	0
2704	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Kaunas. In February 1993 the Kaunas Region Municipality (Kauno rajono savivaldybė) assigned a plot of land measuring 0.15 hectares in the settlement of Noreikiškės to the applicant for the construction of a house (hereinafter “the land”). In May 1995 she signed a land purchase agreement with the municipality and bought the land for 29.70 “single-use investment vouchers” (investiciniai čekiai). The purchase agreement indicated that the nominal value of the land was 2,976 Lithuanian litai (LTL  approximately 862 euros (EUR)). The applicant subsequently obtained a building permit and built a storehouse on the land. On 10 May 2002 the Constitutional Court found that Government regulations which allowed land in Noreikiškės to be sold to private individuals were contrary to the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and the Restitution Law (see Padalevičius v. Lithuania, no. 12278/03, § 18, 7 July 2009). In Decemb	[9]	2	2	0

On 7 September 2004 the music section of the Academy administration published a list of successful candidates in the entrance examination, which included the applicant. The applicant immediately applied to a medical board at Büyükçekmece Public Hospital for a medical report certifying her fitness to study at the Music Academy. On 9 September 2004 that medical board drew up a report stating that the applicant had been diagnosed with hypermetropia with nystagmus and severe bilateral amblyopia. The Board concluded that the applicant should be referred to a higher medical authority. On	[8]	1	2	0
2706	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 29 December 2011 the applicant lodged a request for a residence permit in Croatia on the grounds of family reunification with her partner, Ms D.B., who was living in Sisak. She submitted that she had been educated in Croatia and that she had lived in Zagreb for seventeen years. She also explained that she wanted to live with D.B., with whom she had been in a relationship for two years, and with whom she wanted to establish a household and start a business. By a letter dated 28 December 2011 D.B. stated that she owned a house in Sisak where she wanted to live with the applicant. She explained that she had been in a relationship with the applicant for two years and that they wanted to live together so as to avoid constant travelling and the distance between them.

The first twin died nine hours after her birth. The second twin, who was transferred to a resuscitation and intensive therapy unit at one of the St Petersburg children’s hospitals (“the children’s hospital”) twenty hours after his birth, survived. The applicant was of the opinion that her daughter would also have survived had she been promptly transferred to a resuscitation and intensive therapy unit at a children’s hospital. On 25 May 2003 the applicant’s mother, Mrs D., sent the following telegram to the President of the Russian Federation: “... newborns are dying because of delays in emergency medical treatment.

2708	 The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in St Petersburg. She had a garage and a small storage building (‘the construction’) in Yerevan measuring 21 sq. m. in total, that she had apparently built without authorisation. On 22 July 2005 the Mayor of Yerevan adopted a decision which, inter alia, recognised the applicant’s ownership of the construction and allocated the underlying plot of land to her with the right of lease. On 26 August 2005 a lease agreement, valid until 22 July 2010, was concluded between the Mayor of Yerevan and the applicant. On 5 September 2005, based on the Mayor’s decision of 22 July 2005, the applicant received an ownership certificate in respect of the construction. It appears that on 19 June 2006 the Mayor of Yerevan adopted another decision, which annulled the decision of 22 July 2005 in its part concerning the recognition of the applicant’s ownership in respect of the construction.

On 2 May 1992 the applicant’s husband submitted a request to the Zujūnai District Land Council of the Vilnius Region to buy from the State two hectares of land for individual farming in the village of Zujūnai. On 29 October 1993 the Government adopted a decision establishing, inter alia, the order of allocation of land for individual farming.

On 12 September 2003 the Pervomayskiy District Court of Murmansk granted her claim and ordered that the pension due to the applicant be recalculated and increased. No appeal was lodged against that judgment and on 23 September 2003 it became final and enforceable. On 11 August 2005 the Pervomayskiy District Court of Murmansk quashed the judgment of 12 September 2003 and reopened the proceedings after an application by the respondent authority on the grounds that new circumstances had come to light. On 23 August 2005 the same court rejected the applicant’s pension recalculation claim.	[3, 9]	3	2	0
2711	 The applicant was born in 1997 and lives in Deva. At the time of the events, the eleven-year-old applicant was living with her family in a small village and often used to go to play with two girls from a neighbouring family at their house. The girls, F.C.B. and M.S.B., were about the same age as the applicant. The neighbours’ family (the B. family) had ten children and were also accommodating a relative of theirs, J.V., a fifty-two-year-old man who was unemployed and lived in the family’s vacant cattle stable. According to the statement made by the applicant later to the police, in August 2008 and then again in December 2008, J.V. had dragged her by force while she was playing with her girlfriends at the neighbours’ house, had taken her to an empty room in the house or into the barn and had raped her while holding her down and keeping his hand over her mouth in order to prevent her from screaming.

2712	 The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Plovdiv. In January 2000 the applicant, who had been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, underwent mastectomy of her left breast. In the beginning of 2002 the applicant began to experience pain in the left side of her chest, for which in February 2002 she underwent a bone scintigraphy. The scintigraphy found a pathological uptake of radioactive tracer in her sixth left rib. Another bone scintigraphy in May 2002 confirmed that finding. However, a computerised axial tomography scan carried out later in May 2002 showed a suspected metastasis in the area of the eighth and ninth left ribs rather than the sixth one. The doctor who performed the scan recommended a further bone scintigraphy. Two such scintigraphies, in August 2002 and in January 2003, showed the same findings as the previous two. A radiography in February 2003 showed a suspected pathological lesion in the sixth left rib. But a second computerised axial tom	[]	3	2	0

She was examined on a monthly basis and her pregnancy developed normally. On 8 October 2001, Dr I.M. performed a routine check-up on the applicant’s daughter when she was eight months pregnant. According to the applicant, on that occasion Dr I.M. informed her daughter that she needed to be hospitalised for further investigations because an imminent premature birth was suspected. On the same date the applicant’s daughter was admitted to hospital with the diagnosis of imminent premature birth and sub icterus of unknown aetiology. On 9 October 2001 the applicant’s daughter was examined and blood samples were collected because it was suspected that she was suffering from viral hepatitis and an internal condition.

2714	 The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Szeged. The applicant had a car accident in 1993, sustained serious injuries and, as a consequence, her loss of capacity to work was assessed to be 67 per cent. An insurance company was obliged to pay a monthly allowance to the applicant. In order to redeem the monthly allowance, the insurance company offered 4,400,000 Hungarian forints (17,600 euros) to the applicant as compensation for all damages she has suffered. The applicant and the insurance company concluded an agreement on the lump sum on 25 February 1999. Subsequently, the applicant realised that the lump sum paid by the insurance company did not cover all her damages, believing that the calculation method applied by the insurance company was mistaken. Consequently, on 7 August 2003 the applicant initiated a civil lawsuit against the insurance company requesting the court to declare the agreement invalid and to oblige the insurance company to pay compen	[3]	2	2	0
2715	 The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in London. She is the cousin of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was shot dead by police officers on 22 July 2005.

On 7 March 2005 police officers arrested B. for an administrative offence at Kyiv Pasazhyrskyy railway station. Following the arrest, the police officers found that a driving licence he had shown them did not bear all the requisite information and had a series number linked to another person in the police database. On 8 March 2005 criminal proceedings were instituted against B. for document forgery committed in conspiracy with others. On that day the police recorded telephone conversations between B. and the applicant which suggested that certain documents relating to his driving licence and his study in the driving school had been kept in her flat. The recorded conversations were later documented in a report on 31 October 2005. On 10 March 2005 an investigator with the Pivdenno-Zakhidna r	[4]	2	2	0

2722	 The applicant was born in 1988 and lives in Zagreb. In 1993 the applicant’s father, Ž.L., who was a war veteran, killed the applicant’s mother and her parents and then committed suicide. In 1996 the applicant, represented by his grandmother, sought family disability benefit in connection with the suicide of his father, arguing that the suicide was a consequence of mental derangement caused by his participation in the war. On 19 June 1996 his request was dismissed by the competent Zagreb Office of the Ministry of Defence (Ministarstvo obrane) in charge of war veterans’ affairs on the grounds that the war veteran status of his father had not been established. In July 1996 the applicant challenged that decision before the Ministry of Defence, which accepted his appeal and on 12 December 1997 quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case for re-examination on the grounds that the nature of the applicant’s request had not been adequately establishe	[3]	1	2	0

At the end of the proceedings at issue the courts found that the pre-nationalisation owners were the true owners of the flat by virtue of restitution. Those proceedings were the subject of the applicant’s first application before the Court, in which the Court found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and also a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention due to the length of the court proceedings (see	[3]	3	2	0

In 2005 the applicant brought an action against DTAG, claiming that as a result of the excessive prices paid by the T.AG, he and Mr W. had had to reduce their shares in the company before its stock market launch. For that reason, as well as on account of a lower valuation of the company on the day of the launch, he had sustained damage. On 28 May 2013 the Regional Court dismissed the claim. The applicant appealed against the Regional Court’s decision. In the reasons for the appeal, he made comments on, inter alia, EU law and the respective interpretation by the CJEU and the Federal Court of Justice.

On 28 November 2010 the court decided to detain the applicant on remand for a period of three months, in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had been in possession of a significant amount of drugs (III Kp 2159/10). The court applied this measure due to the high probability that the applicant had committed the offence with which he was charged, the severity of the maximum sentence provided by law for such offence (up to at least eight years’ imprisonment) and the fact that the likelihood of such a penalty might induce the applicant to obstruct the proceedings, as well 	[2]	1	1	0

On 28 June 2012 the psychiatric expert, E.S., submitted her report, which stated that the applicant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. She found that he was incapable of understanding and controlling his actions and that he posed a danger to others, which warranted his psychiatric internment. The expert noted that she had not inspected any medical documents concerning the applicant’s previous psychiatric treatment, but she had interviewed him, examined the criminal case 	[3]	3	1	0
2923	 The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Sofia. The applicant is a former police officer. Criminal proceedings were brought against him in 1996. By a decision of the competent prosecutor of 6 March 1996, as provided under domestic law at the time, the applicant was placed under house arrest. The period of arrest continued until 3 April 1996, when the applicant was remanded in custody. He was once again placed under house arrest on 1 July 1996 and was released on 30 September 1997. The applicant therefore was deprived of his liberty for one year, six months and twenty-five days. In a final judgment of 27 January 1998 the Sofia Military Court found the applicant guilty of failing to perform his duties and he was given a one‑year suspended prison sentence. In another set of proceedings, in a final judgment of 26 March 2003 the Supreme Court of Cassation convicted the applicant of fraud and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment. 	[2, 3]	2	1	0
2924	 The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Batumi. He was a judge at the Khulo District Court. On 12 November 2004 the Supreme Council of Justice initiated disciplinary proceedings against him on the grounds set out in section 2(2)-(a) Act of 22 February 2000 on Disciplinary Proceedings against Judges of Ordinary Courts (hereinafter, “the Disciplinary Proceedings Act” – see paragraphs 16 and 17 below). He was accused in particular of having kept a defendant in a criminal case under his consideration in unlawful detention for the period of fourteen days in September 2004, which fact was qualified as a “manifest breach of the law” within the meaning of the above-mentioned provision of the Disciplinary Proceedings Act. On 18 November 2004 a Panel of the Disciplinary Council of Judges (hereinafter, “the Panel”), composed of Mr K.K.

The prison terms were due to expire on 20 February 2004. While in prison the applicant committed other offences, in respect of which fresh proceedings were brought, in particular for threats, harassment and making false accusations against members of the judiciary. In consequence, on 16 June 2003 the Committals Division (chambre du conseil) of the Liège Court of First Instance ordered that he be placed in a psychiatric institution, pursuant to section 7 of the Law of 9 April 1930 on Social Protection in respect of Mental Defectives, Habit	[1, 2]	2	1	1

The applicant was born in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 1992 and came to Russia in 2003, together with his mother and grandmother. He graduated from a secondary school and a vocational training college in St Petersburg. He has no identity documents. On 7 February 2014 the Kirovskiy District Court in St Petersburg found the applicant guilty of illegally residing in Russia, which was an offence Article 18.8 § 3 of the Code of Administrative Offences, imposed a fine on him and ordered his administrative removal from Russia. The judgment described him as a “native” (уроженец) and a national of Azerbaijan.

2927	 The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Berehove. In the early hours of 22 August 2004 M. was robbed and killed in Berehove, where the applicant was also living. On the same date the applicant and two other people, K.A. and St., were arrested on suspicion of robbing and killing M. According to the applicant, he was apprehended by the police task force at about 10 a.m. on 22 August 2004 in the apartment of his girlfriend and taken to the police station, where he was beaten up and threatened in an attempt to force him to confess to the robbery and murder of M. The case file contains two arrest warrants – one issued by a police officer and another one by the prosecutor investigating the murder (hereinafter “the investigator”), both indicating that the applicant had been arrested by the above-mentioned officials on 22 August 2004 at 6.30 p.m. at their offices. The arrest warrant issued by the investigator indicates that the applicant acknowledged his guil	[3]	1	1	0
2928	 The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Chișinău. The applicant has been involved in numerous protests against alleged acts of corruption and abuse committed by police officers, prosecutors and judges. He was himself the victim of police abuse, ill-treatment and prosecutorial inaction (see Mătăsaru and Saviţchi v. Moldova, no. 38281/08, 2 November 2010). Each year during the professional holiday of the prosecutors or the police he stages protests involving live animals, toilets, caricatures and masks. On 29 January 2013, the professional holiday of prosecutors in Moldova, the applicant conducted a one person demonstration in front of the Prosecutor General’s Office. According to him, the aim of the protest was to draw public attention to the corruption and the control exercised by politicians over the Prosecutor General’s Office. At 10 a.m. he started his protest by installing two large wooden sculptures on the stairs of the Prosecutor General’s Office. The fi	[6]	2	1	0
2929	 The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Silistra. In 2003 an individual installed a printing company in a building situated in close proximity to the building where the applicant was living with his family. Shortly after the printing company began operating, the applicant and his family started resenting the nuisance it was causing. In particular, they found the constant smell of ink and solvents intolerable; also, they were continuously disturbed by the vibrations caused by the printing machines, which reverberated through the walls of their dwelling. Moreover, as time went by, the applicant’s young daughter developed an allergy, which the applicant believed was due to the chemicals used in the printing process and had to take daily medication to keep it under control. Between July 2006 and August 2007, the applicant turned to several State institutions, including regional branches of the hygiene and epidemiological inspectorate, the public health directorate	[6]	2	1	0
2930	 The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Rīga. She worked as an accountant in a building management company (namu pārvalde) from 1989. From the beginning of 1997 she also fulfilled the duties of a cashier and she was fully responsible for any shortfall in the material assets (materiālās vērtības) entrusted to her. On 9 December 1997 the applicant’s colleagues reported to the police that illicit cash withdrawals from the company’s cash registers had been made. Allegedly, the withdrawals had been made by the applicant and her colleague, B.E., by means of annulling the records of cash transactions and then taking the money received in respect of those transactions from the cash register. Internal and external audits were carried out and it was discovered that certain data in the company’s cash registers had been manipulated. Specific amounts of cash and dates were noted in the audits, as well as the customer numbers in respect of which this manipulation h	[3]	2	2	0
2931	 The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Benevento. On 2 April 2013, between 1 and 1.15 p.m., the applicant was stopped by two officers of the Benevento municipal police while she was driving her car. According to the applicant, the police officers checked her driver’s licence and her vehicle documents. An argument broke out between the applicant and the officers. In the applicant’s view, her nervous and hostile attitude led the police officers to suspect that she was intoxicated, which she denied. As the officers did not have the necessary equipment to perform a breathalyser test, they requested the assistance of the road police (Polizia Stradale). The applicant returned to her car. Once she had got back into the vehicle, one of the police officers pulled the car door open and dragged her out by the arm. As recorded in the municipal police officers’ report of 3 April 2013, the applicant had been stopped because she had been driving in an erratic manne	[1]	2	2	1
2932	 The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Moscow. On 24 January 2011 a bomb attack at the Domodedovo airport killed 37 people and injured more than 160. It was later established that the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber and organised by a militant group operating in the North Caucasus. The applicant, who was present at the airport at the time of explosion, sustained multiple injuries to her body (wounds, contusions and fractures) which provoked further complications (cerebral oedema, coma, respiratory and cardiac insufficiency and a traumatic shock). The applicant’s injuries were life-threatening and caused serious harm to her health. Within the framework of the criminal investigation into the bombing, the investigative authorities arrested four persons. On 11 November 2013 the Moscow Regional Court found them guilty of multiple charges, including commission of an act of terror, organisation of a criminal gang and illegal possession of firearms and ammun	[0]	2	2	0
2933	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Mersin. The applicant is a teacher in primary school and at the material time she was a member and secretary of the local branch of the trade union of Education and Science Workers (Eğitim ve Bilim Emekçileri Sendikası). On 28 November 2008 the applicant participated in a demonstration organised by the above mentioned trade union on the theme “No to violence against women”. On 29 June 2009 the District Directorate of National Education imposed a disciplinary sanction in the form of a reprimand on the applicant for her participation in the aforementioned demonstration under Article 125 of the Law no. 657 on Civil Servants. On 10 July 2009 the applicant objected to this decision and requested its annulment. On 29 July 2009 the Disciplinary Board of the Yenişehir district governor dismissed the applicant’s objection considering that the contested decision was in accordance with law and there were 	[7]	2	2	0
2934	 The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Co. Roscommon. In November 1999 the applicant purchased a newly-built house, which has been her dwelling place since then. The sale took the form of two agreements. The first was an agreement to purchase the land from the owners, Mr and Mrs F, for the sum of 5,000 Irish pounds (IEP) (approximately 6,350 euros). The second was a building agreement under which she paid IEP 80,000 (approximately 101,600 euros) to a building company called T and C Developments Ltd. The company was owned by Mr and Mrs F, who were the only shareholders. The house was covered by a guarantee provided by a company known as Homebond. From the time she moved into the house in March 2000, the applicant noted major structural defects in the property. She reported this to Homebond in September 2001. The company carried out an inspection of the house and, in September 2002, offered to make certain repairs to it in accordance with the terms of the guara	[]	3	2	1
2935	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Moscow. On 27 August 2002 the applicant brought civil proceedings against the Administration of the Mirninskiy Ulus of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (“the Administration”), a private person S., her husband B., and a private company A. claiming a title to a flat, damages, and S.’s eviction from the flat. On 18 September 2002 the Mirninskiy District Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (“the District Court”) refused to consider his action, because there already had been a decision of 6 February 2001 taken by the District Court concerning the same dispute. On 13 November 2002 the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic overruled the refusal and remitted the case for a new examination, as the action included a new co-defendant, and, therefore, it could not be said that the dispute was among the same parties. On 15 January 2003 the District Court ordered eviction of S. and her family from the flat a	[3, 9]	2	2	0
2936	 The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Riga. On 24 November 2005 a residential building maintenance services provider, Kurzemes Namu Apsaimniekotājs, a limited liability company (“the plaintiff”), brought a claim against the applicant for recovery of a debt for their services in the amount of 320 Latvian lati (LVL – approximately 455 euros (EUR)). The next day civil proceedings were instituted in that connection. The applicant disagreed; she argued that she did not owe any money to the plaintiff – they had not concluded an agreement for maintenance services and she was free to choose another service provider. In those proceedings the applicant was represented by Mr S. Seļezņovs, who was not a lawyer. On 30 December 2005 a judge of the Riga City Kurzeme District Court (Rīgas pilsētas Kurzemes rajona tiesa – hereinafter “the City Court”) scheduled the first hearing to take place on 21 April 2006. During this hearing the applicant’s representative requested addi	[3]	2	2	0
2937	 The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Manisa. On 17 August 1999 the applicant’s daughter, Nesrin Delibaş, lost her life following the collapse of the building where she resided in Düzce as the result of an earthquake (see M. Özel and Others v. Turkey, nos. 14350/05 and 2 others, § 16, 17 November 2015 for further details regarding that earthquake). According to official records, fourteen other people lost their lives as a result of the collapse of the same building. Shortly after the incident, criminal proceedings were brought against the contractor (H.E.) and the architect (S.D.) of the building in question. On 27 August and 31 August 1999 H.E. and S.D. were questioned by the police and the Düzce public prosecutor, respectively. They denied all accusations in respect of the collapse of the building. During an expert examination of the remains of the building on 26 August 1999, certain problems were noted with the building’s reinforcing rods. It was	[0]	3	2	0
2938	 The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Yerevan. The applicant had a daughter, K.M., who was born on 19 November 1985. On 7 September 2007 at 10 p.m. K.M., who was in the early weeks of pregnancy at the time, was at home with her parents and husband when she fainted and began to have convulsions. An ambulance was called, which arrived 40-45 minutes later. Upon arrival, the ambulance doctor, A.G., found K.M. nearly unconscious, with impaired breathing and low blood pressure. According to the applicant, the doctor was told at that point that K.M. was pregnant. A.G. diagnosed a convulsion syndrome, gave K.M. two injections – one of relanium and one of magnesium – and took her to hospital. It appears that neither the doctor nor the nurse nor the driver of the ambulance helped her family carry K.M. downstairs from the eighth floor of the building and put her into the ambulance. Moreover, although K.M. had not regained consciousness after the injections, A.	[0]	3	2	0
2939	 The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in St Petersburg. She is the mother of the late Mr Denis Aleksandrovich Vyrzhikovskiy. On 1 October 2010 police officers apprehended the applicant’s son and his friend, Ms Z. and took them to the Moskovskiy District Department of the Interior of St Petersburg (УВД по Московскому району г. Санкт‑Петербурга). No record of their arrest was drawn up. For approximately six hours the applicant’s son was ill-treated by police officers He was repeatedly punched in the stomach and hit to the head, right palm and both calves. He was also subjected to the so-called “swallow” method of torture (“ласточка”), with his head, hands and legs being pulled together towards the spine. Two police officers then took the applicant’s son and Ms Z. to another police station. Ms Z. later testified to having seen a bruise on Mr Vyrzhikovskiy’s forehead and to his having been in pain and having had difficulties getting into a police car. 	[0, 1]	2	2	0
2940	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Enfield (United Kingdom). The complaints raised in this application arise out of the Turkish military intervention in northern Cyprus in July and August 1974. The general context of the property issues arising in this connection is set out in the cases of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, §§ 13-16 and 28-33, ECHR 2001‑IV), and Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.) ([GC], nos. 46113/99 and 7 others, §§ 4-16, ECHR 2010). In 1997 the applicant was gifted five plots of land, or shares in them, by her aunt, who died in 1998. In 2008 she was also gifted an additional share of one of the plots of land by her mother. According to the certificates of ownership provided by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus, the applicant is the sole owner of four plots of land and owns a 9/16 share of the fifth plot. The land lies in the village Koma Tou Yialou (Kumyali) in the “TRNC”. The total area of th	[9]	2	2	0
2941	 The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Novyy, Tatarstan Republic, Russia. The domestic authorities opened a criminal investigation in relation to the murder of G. committed on 7 September 2002. The applicant’s husband, Zhavdet Khayrullin, was identified in the course of the investigation as a possible eyewitness. A certain Mr V. was a suspect. On 13 September 2002 the applicant’s husband was taken to Tukayevskiy police station. The exact timing of this, various other circumstances, and the legal grounds and reasons for his detention were the subject of conflicting accounts at domestic level (see, for instance, paragraphs 8 and 23 below). It is apparent from a copy of the police logbook submitted by the applicant that her late husband was taken to the police station by officers Ag. and Na. at around 1 p.m., according to the record, for the purpose of verifying his identity; this verification was completed and he was released at 1.30 p.m. It is also ap	[0, 2]	2	2	0

On 21 April 2006 she was dismissed as part of a reorganisation of the Centre. Another person was subsequently appointed to a position similar to the one previously occupied by the applicant. In May 2006 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Melitopolskyy Local Court (“the Melitopolskyy Court”) seeking reinstatement, salary arrears and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On 24 October 2006 the court rejected the applicant’s claim.

2944	 The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Vilnius. On 29 December 2001 the applicant’s husband asked the national authorities to restore his property rights to a house and a plot of land in Vilnius which had belonged to his grandfather before nationalisation. On 28 February 2002 the applicant’s husband specified his initial request and asked to have the plot of land restored in natura to him if possible, or to provide him with another plot of land in Vilnius. The property rights of the applicant’s husband were restored to some premises (a storehouse) in Vilnius in 2003 and it was decided to pay him monetary compensation for the other premises that had not been returned to him in natura. On 10 April 2003 the Vilnius County Administration informed the Vilnius Municipality that the property rights of the applicant’s husband would be restored to 0.1638 hectares of land for residential purposes.

As she did not obtain a decision, she lodged two further requests, on 24 November 2011 and 6 February 2012. On 11 April 2012 the Ministry rejected her request, holding that she did not meet the relevant criteria to obtain such recognition. In particular, the Ministry found that although she was a professor of law at a university, she did not hold a bachelor’s degree in law (дипломиран правник на правен факултет).

2948	 The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Galway, Ireland. On 27 March 2000 the applicant gave birth to a child, a girl named A. She was married at the time to the child’s father, M.K., and lived in Poland. She already had a son from a previous relationship, B, born in 1993. In 2006 the family moved to Ireland. They lived there together until January 2009, when the couple split up and M.K. moved back to Poland. In June 2009 M.K. went to Ireland on holiday and said he intended to take A to Poland for the summer holidays. The applicant was concerned whether M.K. would return the child to Ireland after their holidays in Poland. On 29 June 2009 she instituted proceedings before Ennis District Court under the Guardianship of Infants Act of 1964, seeking declaration that the habitual residence of the child was in Ireland and that the child was to return to Ireland on 15 August 2009.

2950	 The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Budapest. She is the widow of a well-known Hungarian poet, György Faludy. They married in 2002, and their relationship, partly due to a significant difference in age, as well as their life and work, were constantly the subject of widespread media coverage. They often appeared in the tabloids. The applicant’s husband died in 2006. On an unspecified date in 2008 an article was published in a daily newspaper, Blikk, based on an interview with the applicant, revealing that she wanted to have a child who would be a blood relative of both her and her late husband and have the same intellect and attitude as him. The applicant explained that she envisaged her own sister and her late husband’s grandson being the parents of that child. Following some talks with the applicant, on 26 March 2008 Helyi Téma, at the material time the biggest weekly journal, republished the same story, adding that the late poet’s grand	[]	2	2	0

On 6 February 2004 a certain M. went to the passport registration office where the applicant worked to apply for a passport for her son, who had reached the age of sixteen. As M. subsequently mentioned to the police (see paragraphs 13 and 17 below), she had already applied to the applicant in the past. According to M., when she was waiting in the queue, she heard people saying that the applicant was known for taking bribes and that her “usual rate” was 100 United States dollars (USD). Given the considerable number of visitors, M. could not get an appointment that day. She waited for the applicant in the corridor after work and explained the situation to her.

2952	 The applicant was born in 1997. Following the death of her grandmother in 2010 the applicant, who was a minor at the time, began to show signs of distress. Her parents sought the opinion of a psychiatrist, who emphasised that their daughter was suffering from emotional instability, alternating between periods of anger and periods of agitation. On 19 April 2013 the applicant went to a party where there were drugs and alcohol. The police arrived, seized the drugs and alcohol and checked the identity of the minors who were present. On 23 April 2013 the prefect of Rome informed the public prosecutor at the Rome Youth Court (“the Youth Court”) of the police operation carried out on 19 April 2013 and of the presence of V.C., a minor, at the scene.

In the summer of 2002 she obtained temporary residency status. Before the move, the applicant’s father had been the deputy chair of the Central Bank of Turkmenistan and later a member of a political movement which was critical of the domestic political regime. It appears that, because of her father’s political activity, members of her family were subjected to persecution in Turkmenistan and that in 2006 the applicant’s aunt was tortured and murdered in prison.

According to the applicant, on 7 February 1999 the administrative authorities of the Leninskiy District of Grozny provided her with a housing allocation order no. 842 entitling her to occupy a one‑room municipal flat in Grozny. In 2005 the applicant was registered as living in that flat. In 2007 the authorities decided to conduct an examination of all allocation orders granting occupation of municipal accommodation. The applicant’s housing allocation order dated 7 February 1999 appeared suspicious to the authorities and they commissioned an expert to verify its authenticity. The expert concluded that the allocation order was a forged document. In particular, the order did not correspond to the date on which it had been issued and the impress of a seal on the order had been made with the help of an improvised cliché which in its turn had been made with a help of a computer on the basis o	[4]	2	2	0

In her deposition, the applicant noted that being a man was not a requirement for appointment to the post in question and that she fulfilled all the requ	[4, 8]	2	2	0
2986	 The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Assemini (Italy). By a decision of 4 December 2006 of the Cantonal Prosecutor of the Hercegovina-Neretva Canton (Hercegovačko-neretvanski kanton; one of the ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) the applicant was granted the reimbursement of costs which she had incurred as a witness in the amount of 519 convertible marks (BAM)[1]. On 29 February 2008 the Mostar Municipal Court (“the Municipal Court”) rejected the applicant’s request for the enforcement of this decision, deeming it unenforceable. On 18 September 2008 the Mostar Cantonal Court (“the Cantonal Court”) quashed this decision and remitted the case for reconsideration. On 19 November 2008 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju). On 19 June 2009 the Municipal Court upheld the objection lodged against this decision.

2987	 The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in İzmir. On 21 March 2007 the applicant attended celebrations for the festival of Newroz in Buca, a district of the city of İzmir, as one of the moderators. While she was hosting the event, the applicant addressed the crowd in Kurdish and invited them to observe a minute’s silence in memory of “Newroz martyrs” and martyrs for freedom and democracy. On 10 April 2007 the İzmir Assize Court issued a warrant for the applicant’s arrest and a search of her residence. On 11 April 2007 she was arrested at her house. On 12 April 2007 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge. In her statements to the public prosecutor and the judge, she maintained that she had attended the Newroz celebrations as a moderator and that she had not shouted any illegal slogans. She stated that she had called for a minute’s silence in memory of revolutionary martyrs. The investigating judge rema	[6]	2	2	0
2988	 The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Zagreb. She gave birth to her first three children in hospital. In 2011 she became pregnant with her fourth child and had a due date in February 2012. In November 2011 she sent a letter to the Croatian Chamber of Midwives (Hrvatska Komora Primalja), enquiring about the possibility of having professional assistance with a home birth. She explained that her first three hospital deliveries had gone normally, without the need for much medical intervention, but that she had not felt fulfilled afterwards. She therefore wanted to give birth to her fourth child at home. On 1 December 2011 she received a reply that according to the relevant domestic legislation health professionals, including midwives, were unable to assist with home births. In particular, although the Act on Midwifery allowed the setting up of private practices by midwives, the Healthcare Act, as the general Act in the sector, still did not expressly pr	[]	2	2	0
2989	 The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Ostia Lido. At birth, the applicant was entered in the civil-status registers as male and was given the forename L. However, the applicant stated that she had always identified as female and lived in society as a woman under the forename S. For instance, her work colleagues (the applicant has worked as a civil servant since 1999) had always called her S., and in the photograph on her identity card issued in August 2000 her appearance was that of a woman. In 1999 S.V. began treatment with feminising hormones as part of the gender transition process. On 9 November 2000 she applied to the Rome District Court on the basis of section 3 of Law no. 164 of 1982, stating that she wished to complete the transition process by permanently changing her primary sexual characteristics, and sought authorisation to undergo gender reassignment surgery. In a judgment of 10 May 2001 the District Court found that the applic	[4]	2	2	1
2990	 The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Bucharest. During the events which led to the fall of the communist regime in Bucharest, on 21 December 1989, the applicant suffered injuries caused by impingement and compression, as a result of which she needed 50 days of medical care, her life not being imperilled. In 1990 the military prosecutor’s office opened, of its own motion, several investigations into the ill-treatment and injuries suffered by those participating in the events of December 1989. The main criminal investigation was recorded in file no. 97/P/1990 (currently no. 11/P/2014). As regards the applicant, an investigation was opened under a separate file and she gave a statement as a witness on 23 June 1994. Her case has been further examined at a later date in the main criminal investigation. The most important procedural steps were described in the case Association “21 December 1989” and Others v.

2991	 The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Vilnius. On 17 April 2009 the applicant was officially notified that she was suspected of having organised the embezzlement of property of high value. On 7 May 2009 the applicant was charged with the relevant offences. She denied her guilt. On 22 July 2011 the Vilnius Regional Court held that the legal classification of the charges against the applicant was incorrect, because the total value of the allegedly embezzled property was not high. The court reclassified the charges on the basis of a less serious offence, held that the prosecution had become time-barred and discontinued the proceedings. The prosecutor appealed. On 27 October 2011 the Court of Appeal quashed the decision and remitted the case to the Vilnius Regional Court. After re-examining the case, on 10 June 2013 the Vilnius Regional Court found the applicant guilty of the charges against her. She was given a fine of 12,000 Lithuanian litai 	[3]	3	2	0
2992	 The applicant was born in 1935 and lived in Kalvarija. She died on 8 April 2017. In December 1993 a large sum of money disappeared from A.G.’s mother’s home in the town of Kalvarija. A.G. suspected the applicant’s son R.A., and R.A.’s friend, Z.V., of having stolen the money. As later established by the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 40 below), on 19 April 1994 A.G., acting with accomplices, forced R.A. and Z.V. into a car and drove them to a forest in Kalvarija. R.A. and Z.V. were tied to a tree, interrogated, beaten, put in a hole in the ground and, when they tried to escape, shot, stabbed and thus killed. Both victims were then buried in the forest in an attempt to hide the evidence. Their bodies were never found. On 8 July 1994 the applicant’s daughter reported to the police that her brother R.A. had disappeared.  Having examined the material indicating that on 19 April 1994 R.A. had been placed in a car and had not returned, on 29 August 1994 the pol	[]	3	2	0

An unidentified person presenting a passport in the name of M. and claiming that she was S.’s sister and heir applied to G., a notary, seeking the recognition of her rights in respect of the flat. In support of her claim she submitted a copy of her birth certificate. On 18 March 2009 G. issued a certificate confirming, inter alia, M.’s title to the flat. The city authorities registered M.’s title to the flat in the State land register. On 19 May 2009 an unidentified person posing as M. sold the flat to the applicant. According to the documents submitted by the applicant, the purchase price was 6,499,999 Russian roubles (RUB). The city authorities registered the sale of the flat and the applicant’s title to it in the State land register. On an unspecified date the police opened a 	[9]	2	2	0

From January 2008 she held several seminars entitled “Basic Information on Islam” (Grundlagen des Islams) at the right-wing Freedom Party Education Institute (Bildungsinstitut der Freiheitlichen Partei Österreichs). The seminars were not only open to members of the Freedom Party or invited guests, but were also publicly advertised on its website. In addition, the head of the Freedom Party, H.-C.S., had distributed a leaflet specifically aimed at young voters, advertising them as “top seminars” in the framework of a “free education package”. The applicant had not been involved in the selection of participants. Two of the seminars were held on 15 October and 12 November 2009 respectively, with around thirty participants at each. One of the participants was an undercover journalist working for a weekly journal, N. At the journal’s request, a preliminary investigation was instituted against the applicant, an	[]	2	2	1

In December 2005 he was placed in foster care in Slovenia and has remained there ever since, having only occasional contact with the applicant. The applicant does not attend meetings with the welfare workers and foster parents and does not pay maintenance for him. On 19 November 2007 the applicant gave birth to her second child, M. In April 2008 the competent French authorities placed M. in foster care in France and referred the applicant for psychological counselling. M. was later adopted in France and has no contact with the applicant. On 5 January 2010 the applicant gave birth to her third child, A., in the Postojna Maternity Hospital.

On 23 August 2005, following her participation in a selection procedure, she was appointed educational coordinator of the Hellenic Republic at the General Consulate of Greece in Chicago for a period of two years. On 14 August 2007 the Ministers of Education and Foreign Affairs issued a decision informing all educational coordinators abroad of the end of their term of service. On the same date, the Minister of Education issued a decision informing the educational coordinators that they were to remain in their posts until the completion of the next selection procedure. The applicant’s name was omitted from the second ministerial decision and the post of educational coordinator in Chicago remained vacant. She applied to have the decision annulled, which the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal agreed to do as the applicant had be	[3]	2	2	1
2997	 The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Muğla. On an unspecified date the applicant brought an enforcement order through a bailiff’s office against her former husband, G.F., to collect alimony in arrears and accrued interest. On 9 March 2006 G.F. objected to that order by bringing a case against the applicant before the Datça Enforcement Court. He requested that the court declare the enforcement order null and void on the grounds that he had made the payments in question in full. In the first hearing G.F.’s representative requested the court to take out an expert report to determine whether the payments he had made corresponded to the alleged debt. The court adjourned its examination on the question whether an expert report would be sought to a hearing to be held on 10 May 2006. In that hearing, the applicant’s representative left it to the court’s discretion for an expert to be appointed concerning the determination of the amounts that were 	[3]	2	2	0
2998	 The applicant, Ms Violeta Pulfer, is an Albanian national who was born in 1967 and lives in Tirana. On an unspecified date in 2011 the applicant and her husband moved to Vlora. The applicant agreed to buy a house which had been unlawfully built by S.N. In the meantime, S.N. had lodged an application for the regularisation of the house’s unlawful status. On 19 October 2011 the applicant and S.N. concluded a down‑payment agreement (kontratë kapari) according to which the applicant deposited just under half of the sale price as a down-payment (kapar), the remainder to be paid upon the regularisation of the house’s status and the conclusion of the sale agreement. On 8 December 2011 the applicant moved into the house on the basis of the down-payment agreement. On 12 January 2012 S.N. asked the applicant to vacate the house. The applicant opposed the eviction and reminded S.N. of the obligations arising from the down-payment agreement. It appears that 	[1]	2	2	1
2999	 The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Yerevan. On 2 January 2007 M.G. and V.G., two elderly sisters, were found dead in V.G.’s apartment, where they lived together following which the prosecution started an investigation into their death. It appears that the applicant had known V.G., who had drawn up a will on 5 April 2006 according to which she had bequeathed her apartment to the applicant. On the same day forensic medical examinations, including autopsies, were ordered to determine, inter alia, the cause of death of the two sisters. On 2 February 2007 the expert A.D. issued two opinions (nos. 22 and 23). According to the first one, M.G. had died as a result of acute heart failure brought about by low body temperature while opinion no. 23 stated that V.G. had died as a result of hypothermia. On 9 February 2007 the prosecutor decided to terminate the investigation. Relying on forensic medical opinions nos. 22 and 23, the prosecutor found th	[3]	3	2	0

Her monthly disabled person’s allowance payments in 2010, 2011 and 2012 were 325.40 euros (EUR), EUR 336.20 and EUR 346.30, respectively. Prior to the above, in 2004, the applicant had lodged a claim with the Martin District Land Office (Obvodný pozemkový úrad) for restitution of a suite of real property consisting of several plots which came under special legislation provisions on restitution. On 20 December 2011 she lodged an action against the Land Office with the Žilina Regional Court, sitting as an administrative tribunal, seeking an order for acceleration of the restitution proceedings. This type of action required mandatory legal representation. Accordingly, the action was submitted through a lawyer. The applicant also sought an order for costs. The latter claim was calculated	[3]	2	2	0
3001	 The applicant was born in 1969 and is detained in Verona, Italy, in connection with criminal charges unrelated to the present case. In the early morning of 22 July 2005 a sales clerk, G., was attacked in a shop in Kharkiv where she worked. She suffered multiple cuts, including a penetrating chest wound, which led to pneumothorax. She was hospitalised in an intensive-care unit. According to the subsequent findings of the domestic court which convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery (see paragraph 18 below), the applicant had attacked G., whom he had known previously, and seized a certain amount of cash belonging to her employer, the company that ran the shop. According the applicant’s account, which he maintained throughout the proceedings before the domestic courts and before this Court, G. owed him money and he had gone to the shop to collect the debt. However, G. had attacked him with scissors and, trying to defend himself, he had hit her back, sei	[1, 3]	2	2	0

On 2 April 1998, during her time at the Slavyanoserbskiy Psychoneurological Asylum run by the Luhansk Regional Council (Слав’яносербський психоневрологічний інтернат Луганської обласної ради) (“the asylum”), another patient, B., inflicted grievous bodily harm on the applicant. Her injuries included concussion, a fractured jaw and nose, and numerous cuts on her face. Later she also lost the sight in her right eye and the sight in her left eye deteriorated which, according to the forensic examination report of 25 June 2007, was also due to the trauma sustained by the applicant on 2 April 1998. On 16 September 1998 B. died.

3003	 The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Vietnam. From 1 March 2012 until 25 July 2012 she was detained at Limassol Police Station pending her deportation. She was deported on the latter date. The applicant submitted that throughout her detention the women’s wing at Limassol Police Station had been overcrowded. As result, most of the time she had shared cells with other detainees. When the applicant had been in a double occupancy cell with two bunks, she had shared the cell with up to four other detainees. They all had to share the two bunks. When the applicant had been in a single occupancy cell, which she had initially estimated to measure about 3 to 3.5 sq. m, she had had to share with another detainee and a mattress of about 1.90 m would be placed on the dirty floor alongside her bed. This left only about 30 cm of free space between the mattress and the bed. The mattresses placed in the cells to accommodate additional detainees were filthy and sleeping on t	[1]	2	2	1
3004	 The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Vilnius. On 30 October 1991 the applicant’s sister applied for the restoration of her property rights to her late father’s land, which was located in Pylimėliai village, city of Vilnius. She indicated that the applicant was also a successor to the same plot of land. It appears that the applicant’s father had owned some land in Pylimėliai village. According to the most recent information available to the Court, the exact plot of land he had owned was 6.0961 hectares. It appears that the applicant’s restitution process took two directions: at first she agreed to receive part of the land in the Vilnius region and then she asked to receive another 0.32 hectares in the Vilnius region, and she wanted to receive some land in the city of Vilnius (see paragraphs 8-22 below). On 26 May 2000 the applicant asked the authorities to restore her property rights to her father’s land by giving her plots of land of equivalent val	[9]	2	2	0

On 18 April 2003 the applicant’s employer, Grebinkivska District State Administration (“the Administration”), received a statement from the Grebinkivskyy District prosecutor’s office dated 17 April 2003 (“the prosecutor’s statement”). The document analysed the amount of preventive social work performed by the applicant in connection with minors in 2002 and concluded that the applicant, as the head of the juvenile service department of the Administration, had no knowledge of the relevant law and displayed an irresponsible attitude towards her professional duties. The document contained a demand that the applicant be disciplined. On 21 April 2003 the Administration examined the prosecutor’s statement and decided to give the applicant a warning against the use of excessive formalism in her work. On 14 May 2003 the Administration informed the prosecutor’s office of the actions taken in consequence of their considera	[3]	2	2	0

The judgments were either enforced with a delay or remained unenforced until the date of receipt of the parties’ latest submissions, as specified in the table below. According to the Government, to enforce the judgment of 23 June 2005 the authorities held a public auction to determine a company to perform the renovation of the applicant’s flat in Yakutsk. On 3 October 2008 the applicant refused to let the employees of the winner private company in, and they were unable to start the renovation works in the flat. In November 2008 the bailiffs sent a notification to the applicant that the renovation works were scheduled for 19 November 2008, but the notification was never delivered to her, as in the meantime she had moved to a different town.

In December 2003 the applicant was stopped on the street by two policemen for an identity check. She was then taken to a police station to have her identity verified. According to the applicant, she was released from custody several days later following the intervention of a certain A., who was also an ethnic Chechen and was employed as a police officer attached to the organised crime division of the Moscow police department. In the meantime she was dismissed by her employer because of her unauthorised absence from work. In February 2004 A. helped the applicant to be reinstated at work.

3008	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Juodšiliai in the Vilnius Region. In 1991 the applicant’s mother applied for restoration of her property rights to land which had been nationalised by the Soviet regime. On 27 September 2001 the Vilnius County Administration (hereinafter “the VCA”) restored the applicant’s mother’s property rights by giving her a plot of six hectares in Pagiriai, an area in the Vilnius city municipality. As the applicant’s mother had died in 1995, the applicant was issued with a certificate of inheritance in respect of the plot on 13 March 2003. On 4 December 2008 the prosecutor of the Vilnius Region (hereinafter “the prosecutor”) lodged a claim with the Vilnius Regional Court, seeking to have the applicant’s mother’s property rights to the six hectares given to her annulled.

On 7 February 2003 he had drawn up a notarised public will in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Civil Code. He had bequeathed his whole estate to his wife, namely: one-third of a 2,000 sq. m plot of farmland near Komotini; one-half of a 127 sq. m apartment, a parking space and a basement in a block of flats in Komotini; one-quarter of a shop in Komotini with a surface area of 24 sq. m, and another shop measuring 31 sq. m in Komotini, which was subsequently expropriated in return for compensation that has already been paid to the applicant; and four properties in Istanbul.

Her duty was to count cash money brought in bags from the bank’s branches. On 18 September 2015 the applicant came to work at around 7.40 a.m. and started counting money in bags of cash. After having counted the money from four bags she went to the toilet and, upon her return, she heard one of her colleagues saying that one of the uncounted bags lacked its seal. She did not pay much attention to that, since that was not the first time when a seal was missing. The colleague who found the bag without a seal was instructed by her superior to count the money in the bag. It appeared that forty-seven thousand euros (EUR) was missing from that bag. Another superior was called in and a search of the premises was carried out. The branch from which the bag of money came was contacted;	[2]	2	2	0
3012	 The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Lipetsk. On 18 September 2007 the applicant signed a private contract for the purchase of a flat in Lipetsk. The seller was Ms E.M.T., acting on behalf of herself and her daughter Maria, a minor. The contract stipulated that the property was not “mortgaged, encumbered by any claims of third parties, disputed or charged”. The flat in question had been allocated as social housing to Ms E.M.T. and her husband, Mr V.A.V., in 1979. They had lived there with their four children: Yelena, Mikhail, Dmitriy and Maria. Mikhail and Dmitriy were given long prison sentences in 1998 and 2004 respectively and were still serving them at the material time. Yelena moved out in 1997 to continue her studies in Dagestan. In 2006, Ms E.M.T and Maria became the sole owners of the property by way of privatisation, while Mr V.A.V., Mikhail, Dmitry and Yelena declined in writing to exercise their right to obtain their shares of the privatised flat	[9]	2	2	0
3013	 The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Bogdany. On 26 January 2004 the applicant obtained from the State a deed of title to an agricultural plot of land (an official Land Registry title) based on a decree issued by the Varvynska local administration on 22 December 2003. This amounted to the official registration of her title to the land in accordance with the domestic procedures. At that point the applicant had not filed a request for the boundaries of the plot to be marked out and was not farming the land. On 26 July 2004 the local administration concluded a lease agreement with the private company B., according to which the company would rent the applicant’s land and pay the rent to the local administration. The applicant was not informed about this agreement. She learnt of the lease agreement only in September 2004, after the private company B. had planted seeds on the land.

In the course of her employment the applicant had two children, born on 27 March 2008 and 7 May 2010. The applicant spent her maternity leave in the United States and regularly sent requests to extend that leave every six months for the duration of her absence. In particular, she sent such requests in March and September 2009 as regards her first child and then in April and September 2010 as regards her second child. It appears that the applicant’s maternity leave was extended, based on those requests. In March 2011 her leave was further extended until 1 September 2011. According to the applicant, on 19 August 2011 she requested another extension of her maternity leave. She hande	[3]	2	2	0

Three of them then went to the other side of the pond (in the documents submitted also referred to as a “lake”), while the applicant’s husband fished near the car. Mr Z., Mr D. and Mr Yu. fished about 40 to 60 metres from each other and about two hundred metres or so from Mr Magamedov. At about 9 p.m. Mr Z., Mr D. and Mr Yu. heard gunfire coming from the direction of the car. They went in that direction and saw six or seven men in military camouflage uniforms next to their car and heard them speaking Russian. Those men had arrived in armoured personnel carriers (“APCs”) and were using flashlig	[0]	2	2	0
3018	 The applicant was born in 1988 and lives in Beiuş. The applicant was married to I.T. and had a daughter with him, born in 2011. In May 2013 the applicant left the marital home and the child remained with I.T. On 21 May and 5 June 2013 respectively I.T. and the applicant filed for divorce and each sought sole custody of the child. On 10 December 2013 the Beiuş District Court granted the couple’s divorce and joint custody of the child, and decided that the child should remain with her father. In a final decision of 17 June 2014 the Bihor County Court quashed the above decision in part and decided that the child should live with the applicant. I.T. refused to hand over the child. On 4 July 2014 the applicant applied to the bailiff’s office for enforcement of the decision of 17 June 2014. On 5 August and 25 September 2014 I.T. went to the bailiff’s office alone and told the bailiff that the child refused to live with her mother. A representative of the Bihor 	[4]	1	2	0

On 20 May 2008 around 7 p.m. the applicant was walking home from the village of Căpâlna, where she had been helping her husband all day in the fields. Near the village of Mica, she was approached by an unknown individual, identified later as T.F.S., who started walking alongside her and who tried unsuccessfully to engage her in conversation. At some point, they met two men. One of them, whom the applicant knew by sight as I.L., stopped T.F.S. and asked him if he wanted to accompany him in order to finalise a transaction over a horse. T.F.S. replied that he would join him later. In her statement to the police made later (see paragraph 17 below), the applicant described the subsequent events as follows: After the two men went away, T.F.S. continued walking along with her. He eventually offered her money and a mobile phone if she agreed to have or	[1, 4]	2	2	0

She is married to a businessman and was formerly a talk show host and active participant in public debate. In August and September 2010 the applicant lodged two complaints with the Press Complaints Commission (Pressens Faglige Utvalg) against two publications owned and controlled by Mr Trygve Hegnar: the weekly and daily business newspapers Kapital and Finansavisen. Mr Hegnar also owned and controlled the internet portal Hegnar Online, which focused mainly on business and financial news. All three publications had, from late summer 2010, published articles concerning the applicant’s role and relationship with a wealthy, elderly widow from whom she would inherit.

3021	 The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Galgiai in the Vilnius Region. In 1991 the applicant applied for restoration of her property rights to land which had been nationalised by the Soviet regime. On 23 December 2002 the Vilnius County Administration (hereinafter “the VCA”) restored the applicant’s property rights by giving her two plots of 2.44 hectares and 0.16 hectares in Galgiai, an area in the Vilnius city municipality. It appears that, even though the decision referred to 2.44 hectares, the applicant was in fact given a plot measuring 2.2859 hectares. On 22 May 2007 the applicant sold the plot of 2.2859 hectares to company S. for 2,500,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL  approximately 724,000 euros (EUR)). The sale agreement indicated that company S. was purchasing the plot with the aim of transferring it to company V. The agreement was certified by a notary. Company S. had previously concluded a lease agreement (išperkamosios nuomos sutartis) with com	[9]	3	2	0
3022	 The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Novi Sad. On 1 June 2004 the applicant instituted civil proceedings seeking reimbursement for income she had lost because of a car accident. On 25 February 2008 the Novi Sad Court of First Instance delivered a judgment partly in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to pay her a certain amount in that respect. On 30 October 2008 the Novi Sad District Court partly quashed the judgment of 25 February 2008 and remitted the case, upholding the remainder of the judgment. On 2 July 2010 the Novi Sad Court of First Instance rejected the applicant’s claim in the remitted part. On 30 January 2012 the Novi Sad Court of Appeal partly upheld the judgment of 2 July 2010 and partly reversed it granting certain applicant’s claims. On 5 February 2015 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s complaint about the length of those proceedings, taking into consideration that the civil 	[3]	3	2	0
3023	 The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Uxbridge. The applicant claims to have entered the United Kingdom illegally on 18 November 2003. She pleaded guilty to offences of cruelty towards her son and was sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment with a recommendation that she be deported. On 5 August 2008 the Home Secretary served her with notice of intention to make a deportation order. On 8 August 2008 the applicant’s criminal sentence ended and she was thereafter detained under immigration powers from 8 August 2008 to 6 July 2011 (2 years, 10 months, 27 days). The present application is the second one made to this Court by the applicant. In her first application the applicant complained about her detention from 8 August 2008 to 28 April 2010. This Court found that during this period, there was a lack of due diligence on the part of the authorities from 19 June 2009 to 14 December 2009 (a period of five months and 26 days). Accordingly, it found a violation of	[2]	2	2	1
3024	 The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Vratsa. In 1991, following the adoption of the Agricultural Land Act which provided, inter alia, for the restitution of formerly collectivised land, the applicant applied for the restitution of land previously owned by her father. In a decision of 20 May 1996 the competent body, the Oryahovo land commission, held that the heirs of the applicant’s father (the applicant and her sister) were entitled to the restitution of, inter alia, a plot of land of 11,800 square metres enlisted as “forest”. The decision indicated that the heirs of the applicant’s father had established his property title with a notarial deed. It stated additionally that the plot of land was “situated in an area under section 4”. That provision (section 4 of the transitional provisions of the Agricultural Land Act, hereinafter “section 4”) concerns plots of land which were offered by the Communist authorities for use of private persons, and stip	[9]	3	2	0
3025	 The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Golasowice. On 1 February 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings before the Jastrzębie Zdrój District Court for the purposes of establishing an easement. In particular the applicant sought a decision allowing her to use a strip of land belonging to her neighbours as a roadway allowing her access to her property. The roadway in question, which has been used by her in the past, runs along a causeway (grobla) between fishponds. By a decision of 11 July 2000 (file no. I Ns 57/99) the Jastrzębie Zdrój District Court allowed the applicant’s claim. The other party appealed against this decision. On 15 November 2000 the Katowice Regional Court quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case (file no. III Ca 661/00). At a hearing on 13 March 2001 the court ordered the preparation of an expert opinion. Two experts declined the invitation to prepare an opinion, and the third expert approached by	[3]	2	2	0

3028	 The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Tolyatti. On 8 May 2007 the applicant’s daughter, Z., was found hanged in the apartment where she had been living with her husband, Ch., and their two minor children. On the same day the law-enforcement bodies of the Nenetskiy Autonomous Region were informed of Z.’s death. An on-site inspection and an initial examination of Z.’s body were carried out. Statements were obtained from those who had had contact with Z. shortly before her death and a post-mortem examination of Z.’s body was ordered. The post-mortem examination (in a report of 1 June 2007) established that Z. had died as a result of mechanical asphyxia caused by deliberate self‑harm by means of hanging. Apart from a strangulation mark, multiple bruises and abrasions were discovered on Z.’s face, forearms and shins which could have manifested shortly before Z.’s death as a result of impacts from blunt objects, such as blows inflicted on her face, arms a	[0]	2	2	0
3029	 The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Yalta, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. On 11 October 1997, following a purchase agreement, the applicant became owner of flat no. 2 at 1 Pushkinska Street in Yalta (“the Pushkinska flat”) in a multi-dwelling building which had been built before 1917 (“the Pushkinska building”) and was a municipal property. The flat had one room and measured 37.5 sq. m. According to the applicant, she did not reside in the flat and rented it out in the summer as it was located in the historic part of the city centre and next to the beach. At the beginning of 2005, all flats in the Pushkinska building – with the exception of two which belonged to the applicant and K.– had been bought by a private construction company, JSC Zodiak-tsentr (hereinafter “the Company”).

3030	 The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Piaski. On 2 May 2011 the Koszalin Regional Court issued a payment order (nakaz zapłaty) against the applicant. It stipulated that she was to pay to the claimant, a certain D.K., the sum of 156,000 Polish zlotys (PLN), equivalent to 36,000 euros (EUR). The applicant lodged an appeal (zarzuty) within the time-limit. She complained that the payment order had been based on a lease contract which had turned out to be null and void but which she had secured by a blank bill of exchange signed by her. She challenged that basis for the payment order and considered it illegal and unfounded. She further applied for exemption from the court fees. On 13 July 2011 a court officer from the Koszalin Regional Court (referendarz sądowy) decided to partly exempt her from the fees. The court examined in detail the financial situation of the applicant. In particular it noted that in 2010 her company had generated a gross income of 	[3]	2	2	0
